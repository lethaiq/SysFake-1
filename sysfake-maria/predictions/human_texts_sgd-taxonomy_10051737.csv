1,"""We've prevailed on testing,"" Trump said Monday, standing between the signs.

While the US may have performed the most number of coronavirus tests, it's nowhere near the world's leader in testing per capita, multiple studies show.

And health experts say the US isn't close to the rate of testing needed to safely reopen the economy.

How many tests have been done?

Public health experts say we don't need to test every American right now. But they say the US still isn't conducting enough tests to stop the spread of the virus enough to safely reopen the economy.

""This is due to a growing consensus among experts that the US is faring worse in this outbreak than previously thought,"" the institute said. ""Social distancing measures have been able to stall the sharp increase of infection and death rates -- but unlike in many other nations, new cases are only very slowly decreasing.""

On Monday, Trump said the US is conducting about 300,000 tests per day.

How does the US stack up against other countries?

There's no single definitive ranking system because there are variations in how some countries report their testing.

""The number of tests does not refer to the same in each country -- one difference is that some countries report the number of people tested, while others report the number of tests (which can be higher if the same person is tested more than once),"" the Oxford researchers said on their website OurWorldInData.org

So CNN looked at different rankings, and each study showed that many other countries have higher per capita testing rates.

""Adding together just the number of tests conducted by Russia, Germany and Italy -- the next three countries that have done the most testing -- would produce a higher figure. ... So, Trump's claim is not even close to being accurate.""

Republican senators say testing is still insufficient

Lawmakers have urged the administration to keep ramping up testing to help states allow businesses and schools to open.

""All roads back to work and back to school run through testing. And that what our country has done so far on testing is impressive, but not nearly enough,"" Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee said Tuesday.

""I find our testing record nothing to celebrate whatsoever,"" Romney said. ""The fact is (South Korea's) test numbers are going down, down, down now because they don't have the kind of outbreak now. Ours are going up, up, up, because they have to.""",https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/12/health/us-coronavirus-testing-per-capita/index.html,1

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Fox News apologized Saturday for how it displayed a chart correlating the stock market’s performance with the aftermath of the deaths of George Floyd, Martin Luther King Jr. and Michael Brown.

The graphic that aired Friday to illustrate market reactions to historic periods of civil unrest “should have never aired on television without full context. We apologize for the insensitivity of the image and take this issue seriously,” the cable channel said in a statement.

The chart included on “Special Report with Bret Baier” illustrated gains made by the S&P 500 index after King’s assassination in 1968; the Ferguson, Missouri, police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in 2014, and the May 25 death of Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody. It also measured the financial yardstick against the 1991 acquittal of Los Angeles police officers in the beating of Rodney King.

It was shown as part of a segment with Fox News and Fox Business reporter Susan Li focusing on the market rally that followed an unexpectedly lower number of jobless claims.

Other business publications and TV channels in recent days have compared the market’s performance to current and historic social upheaval, but with significant background and explanation.

Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Illinois, tweeted that the graphic makes it clear that Fox News “does not care about black lives,” while Michael Steele, former Republican National Committee chair and a MSNBC political analyst, posted, “This is how they mourn the loss of black men at #FoxNews - by how much the stock market goes up.”

Later Saturday, on Fox’s “America’s News HQ” telecast, anchor and senior correspondent Eric Shawn said the graphic should not have been used.

“Last night, Fox News Channel aired an infographic attempting to show the stock market on occasion gained ground in the midst of turmoil, civil unrest and even tragedy,” Shawn said. “In trying to make that point, the program ‘Special Report’ failed to explain the context of the times we are living in and should not have used that graphic.”",https://apnews.com/f18aadd2d6a2868c3765a02c2c9dfa13,1
1,"In its separate Twitter account, the White House jabbed directly at Mr. Dorsey: “The President did not glorify violence. He clearly condemned it. @Jack and Twitter’s biased, bad-faith ‘fact-checkers’ have made it clear: Twitter is a publisher, not a platform.”

And Dan Scavino, the president’s deputy chief of staff, said Twitter should be targeting the protesters in Minneapolis. “Twitter is targeting the President of the United States 24/7, while turning their heads to protest organizers who are planning, plotting, and communicating their next moves daily on this very platform,” he wrote. He added that Twitter was full of it and “more and more people are beginning to get it.”

Twitter said it had decided to restrict Mr. Trump’s tweet about the protests in Minnesota “based on the historical context of the last line, its connection to violence, and the risk it could inspire similar actions today.” It had applied a warning label on a tweet from the Brazilian minister of citizenship, Osmar Terra, last month, but the label was not for glorifying violence.

Mr. Dorsey also tweeted on Friday morning that social networks’ fact-checking process should use open-source technology — software that is created and shared for general use — and be verifiable by everyone. He did not respond to a request for comment.

The conflict has thrown Twitter into chaos, with employees racing to take action on Mr. Trump’s tweets while also scrambling to protect themselves from harassment. After Mr. Trump and his allies lashed out at one Twitter employee who had publicly criticized Mr. Trump and other Republican leaders, other employees removed their company affiliation from their social media profiles or locked their accounts from public view.

First Amendment scholars said Friday that Mr. Trump and his allies had it backward and that he was the one trying to stifle speech that clashed with his own views.

“Fundamentally this dispute is about whether Twitter has the right to disagree with, criticize, and respond to the president,” said Jameel Jaffer, executive director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. “Obviously, it does. It is remarkable and truly chilling that the president and his advisers seem to believe otherwise.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/technology/trump-twitter-minneapolis-george-floyd.html,1
1,"Elon Musk and singer Grimes have confirmed they have named their baby X Æ A-12.

The Space X CEO announced the birth of their son on Monday. ""Mom & baby all good,"" he said on Twitter.

He posted that the child would be called X Æ A-12 Musk and his girlfriend later offered an explanation to her followers on social media.

The name X Æ A-12 has been trending on Twitter with many asking how the name will be pronounced.

What does the name mean?

When Musk, known to joke on Twitter, announced the name, many people questioned whether he was being serious.

However, Canadian singer Grimes, real name Claire Boucher, explained the name's meaning to her fans.

Æ, a ligature of a and e known as ash, appeared in Latin and Old English but has mostly fallen out of use. However, in some languages such as Danish, Norwegian and Icelandic, Æ is classed as a letter.

The singer has used Æ before, naming a song on her latest album 4ÆM.

The A-12 is a Lockheed plane built for the CIA. It was known by designers during its development as Archangel.

She also claims Archangel is her favourite song but does not explain who the song is by.
• New dad Elon Musk puts luxury homes up for sale

It remains unclear how the name is pronounced. However, when someone on Twitter asked Musk whether it could be X Ash Archangel, Musk liked the comment, giving the biggest clue as to how it might sound.

It's thought that Grimes may have given birth in California where certain names cannot be registered.

The rules there stipulate that no pictographs, ideograms and diacritical marks for example è, ñ, ē, ç can be used when registering the birth. Names have to consist of the 26 letters of the alphabet.

California isn't the only place in the world with regulations on baby names.

In New Zealand, the name 4Real fell foul of authorities because names cannot start with a number.

A couple went to the high court in Sweden after tax officials deemed their child's name Metallica ""inappropriate"".

Under Swedish law, both first names and surnames need to win the approval of authorities before they can be used.

However, in 2014, three babies in Scotland were named M, R and T. Other names people have chosen, according to the National Records of Scotland, include Daiquiri and Spartacus.

While much of the economy grinds to a halt, Amazon is doing more business than ever. The company has announced it is hiring 100,000 workers to try to meet surging demand. In 2019, Amazon had over $280 billion in revenue and $11.9 billion in profits. As more Americans shift their shopping online, it will likely do better this year. But, as the pandemic continues, Amazon maintains one of the stingiest paid sick leave policies among major corporations.

As Popular Information reported last week, a significant number of Amazon's workforce — particularly part-time employees and contract workers — are not receiving paid sick time.

In response to the pandemic, Amazon said it would provide two weeks of sick leave to ""all Amazon employees diagnosed with COVID-19 or placed into quarantine."" Kroger had a similar policy until Saturday when Kroger expanded its policy to cover workers with COVID-19 symptoms or who need to care for sick family members. Amazon, however, has held firm.

Amazon's large contract workforce, which delivers packages and performs other critical tasks, is in even worse shape. Amazon is not providing any sick leave at all for these workers, even if they test positive for COVID-19. Instead, these workers must apply to the ""Amazon Relief Fund"" and apply for a grant to cover their sick leave. The fund is ""focused on supporting our U.S.-based Delivery Associates employed by Delivery Service Providers, our Amazon Flex Delivery Partners, and Associates working for Integrity Staffing, Adecco Staffing, and RES Staffing, and drivers and support team members of line haul partners under financial distress due to a COVID-19 diagnosis or quarantine.""

Amazon donated $25 million to the fund and is soliciting individual donations to add to the pot. It initially included an option to donate by text.

Isn't it a bit unseemly for Amazon, a company owned by the richest person in the world, to be soliciting donations to pay for workers' sick leave? Why isn't Amazon just paying people who contracted COVID-19 while doing essential work for Amazon?

Instead of changing its policy, Amazon tweaked the wording of its solicitation and eliminated the option to donate by text.

Amazon has increased its hourly pay by $2 per hour and doubled pay for overtime. Higher pay is a positive. But combined with minimal paid sick leave, increased hourly rates further incentivizes Amazon workers to show up sick.

Two weeks ago, Popular Information's reporting resulted in Darden, the parent company of Olive Garden, providing paid sick leave to 170,000 employees. This week, following multiple reports in this newsletter, Kroger significantly expanded its paid sick leave policy for 450,000 workers.

Trump has been the most consistent source of misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Americans are inundated with false information during Trump's daily press conference, which Trump uses to air grievances and make wild claims.

In a March 19 press conference, Trump extolled the virtues of an anti-malaria drug called chloroquine, describing it as a safe and promising treatment for COVID-19.

Now, a drug called chloroquine — and some people would add to it “hydroxy-.” Hydroxychloroquine. So chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Now, this is a common malaria drug. It is also a drug used for strong arthritis. If somebody has pretty serious arthritis, also uses this in a somewhat different form. But it is known as a malaria drug, and it’s been around for a long time and it’s very powerful. But the nice part is, it’s been around for a long time, so we know that if it — if things don’t go as planned, it’s not going to kill anybody. ...And it’s shown very encouraging — very, very encouraging early results. And we’re going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately. And that’s where the FDA has been so great. They — they’ve gone through the approval process; it’s been approved. And they did it — they took it down from many, many months to immediate. So we’re going to be able to make that drug available by prescription or states.

Later in the press conference, the FDA Commission, Dr. Stephen Hahn, was forced to clarify that the FDA has not approved chloroquine to treat COVID-19 and has no plans to immediately make it available for that purpose. Instead, Hahn said, the FDA would conduct ""a clinical trial — a large, pragmatic clinical trial"" to ""actually see if that benefits patients.""

Trump was not dissuaded. ""Dr. Hahn is the expert, but a lot of reasons that I would have to think that it could have a very positive effect or a positive effect,"" Trump said near the end of the press conference. ""I think it’s, to me, very, very exciting.""

On Monday, Banner Health, which operates 28 hospitals across several states, was forced to issue a warning ""that chloroquine, a malaria medication, should not be ingested to treat or prevent this virus."" Why?

Health officials in Nigeria ""reported two cases of chloroquine poisoning.""

After the death was reported, Trump returned to the podium on Monday night and repeated his claims about chloroquine. He said that the drug, in combination with others, is ""looking very very good."" He said it would be distributed to ""a lot of people in New York"" tomorrow morning. He then delivered a rambling story about how chloroquine could take care of COVID-19 in a matter of hours.

On March 12th, 2020, Anderson Cooper and Dr. Sanjay Gupta held a global town hall on “Corona Facts and Fears.�? During the discussion, Anderson said to the viewing audience, “And, again, if you are concerned about coronavirus, and you haven’t gotten a flu shot…you should get a flu shot.�?

Setting safety and efficacy of influenza vaccination aside, is Anderson’s claim that the flu shot will help people fight COVID-19 remotely true? The short answer is no.

In fact, the results of many peer-reviewed, published studies prove that Anderson’s recommendation may have been the worst advice he could have given the public.

In searching the literature, the only study we have been able to find assessing flu shots and coronavirus is a 2020 US Pentagon study that found that the flu shot INCREASES the risks from coronavirus by 36%. “Receiving influenza vaccination may increase the risk of other respiratory viruses, a phenomenon known as “virus interference…’vaccine derived’ virus interference was significantly associated with coronavirus…�? Here are the findings:

Examining non-influenza viruses specifically, the odds of coronavirus in vaccinated individuals were significantly higher when compared to unvaccinated individuals with an odds ratio (association between an exposure and an outcome) of 1.36. In other words, the vaccinated were 36% more likely to get coronavirus.

Many other studies suggest the increased risk of viral respiratory infections from the flu shot:

This CDC supported study concluded an increased risk of acute respiratory illness (ARI) among children <18 years caused by non-influenza respiratory pathogens post-influenza vaccination compared to unvaccinated children during the same period.

2011 Australian Study: Flu shot doubled risk of non-influenza viral infections and increased flu risk by 73%.

A prospective case-control study in healthy young Australian children found that seasonal flu shots doubled their risk of illness from non-influenza virus infections. Overall, the vaccine increased the risk of virus-associated acute respiratory illness, including influenza, by 73%.

2012 Hong Kong Study: Flu shots increased the risk of non-flu respiratory infections 4.4 times and tripled flu infections.

A randomized placebo-controlled trial in Hong Kong children found that flu shots increased the risk of non-influenza viral ARIs fivefold (OR 4.91,CI 1.04—8.14) and, including influenza, tripled the overall viral ARI risk (OR 3.17, CI 1.04—9.83).

2017 Study: Vaccinated children are 5.9 more likely to suffer pneumonia and 30.1 times more likely to have been diagnosed with Allergic Rhinitis than unvaccinated children.

Vaccinated children were 30.1 times more likely to have been diagnosed with Allergic Rhinitis and 5.9 times more likely to have been diagnosed with pneumonia than unvaccinated children.

2014 Study: Influenza-vaccinated children were 1.6 times more likely than unvaccinated children to have a non-influenza “Influenza-like-illness” (ILI).

The well-respected Cochrane Collaboration’s comprehensive 2010 meta-analysis of published influenza vaccine studies found that the influenza vaccination has “no effect�? on hospitalization, and that there is “no evidence that vaccines prevent viral transmission or complications.�? The Cochrane Researchers concluded that the scientific evidence “seem[s] to discourage the utilization of vaccination against influenza in healthy adults as a routine public health measure.�?

In their meta-analysis, the Cochrane researchers accused the CDC of deliberately misrepresenting the science in order to support their universal influenza vaccination recommendation.

(CNN) All living organisms mutate and adapt to maximize survival in their ecologic niche. For months, scientists have been looking into whether the novel coronavirus -- known as SARS-CoV-2 -- is mutating and becoming more transmissible or more lethal. Recent evidence points to a preliminary answer to half the question: yes, a study has found that the virus has mutated and the dominant strain today is now capable of infecting more human cells. But the scientists say more research is needed to show whether this changed the course of the pandemic, and it remains unclear whether this mutation is more lethal.

Almost immediately after the outbreak emerged, researchers began looking for patterns of change among the tens of thousands of viral genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2. The search was made possible thanks to the willingness of researchers around the world to upload their data to a common database . The data is open source, meaning anyone with a computer can access and analyze the data.

The alert that a change in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 was afoot first emerged from researchers skilled in the art of deciphering the messages encoded in the genome of HIV-1, the virus that causes AIDS. The ability to find meaning in over one billion bits of such information has been honed by decades of research on the ever-changing genomes of HIV-1, which can make a life or death difference in how the virus responds to antiviral drugs. Once you know the tale the genomes tell, you can choose which drugs to use to treat a specific strain of the virus.

The researchers studying the SARS-CoV-2 genome first noticed that one mutation, known as D614G, dominated all others. It first appeared in February as a rare variant in Europe , before spreading and overtaking other strains in Italy and other countries. The research team quickly identified a single change in the virus genome. The mutation affects the spike protein on the outer surface of the virus, for which the coronavirus is named (the Latin word corona means ""crown"" or ""halo""). The spike is of special importance in the life of the virus, since it is the mechanism that allows the virus to recognize and attach itself to a host cell before infecting it. The original authors speculated that the change improves the ability of the virus to stick tightly to mucous membranes in the nose or eyes to begin the process of infection.

The original report was met with skepticism . Some asked whether the dominance of this new strain was the result of an unrelated phenomenon. Given that the researchers had been relying only on publicly available data and computer analyses of the genome, they were unable to definitively conclude that their idea was the only reasonable explanation for the emergence of the new dominant strain.

The Scripps Research Institute in Florida answered this question in an unreviewed research manuscript published Friday. The researchers used an elegant set of methods to show that one small mutation stabilized the spike protein, which typically sheds from the surface of the virus. ""The mutation had the effect of markedly increasing the number of functional spikes on the viral surface,"" senior author Hyeryun Choe said. ""The number -- or density -- of functional spikes on the virus is 4 or 5 times greater due to this mutation."" The result: Each mutant virus particle has an increased ability to infect target cells.

This study clearly shows the virus is evolving. It also found the mutation was nearly 10 times more infectious in a laboratory setting than other strains. With genomic analyses showing that this strain has become the dominant one, the findings could explain why the novel coronavirus has spread so widely in Europe, the United States and Latin America.

Does more transmissible mean the strain is more lethal? Not that we can observe, as of now. From the perspective of the virus and its capacity for survival, it is better to allow those who have been infected to live and spread the virus, rather than die.

Is this the end of SARS-CoV-2's evolution? Not by a long shot. Doctors in northeastern China have noted that patients in a new cluster of cases appear to carry the virus for a longer period of time and take longer to test negative. They also found that patients were taking longer to show symptoms after infection. The virus could be mutating to become more persistent as another way to survive, since those who carry the virus for a longer period have more opportunities to infect others. Understanding the biochemical basis for this change will be fascinating.

Last month a pair of manuscripts examined variants in one of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins, specified by the orf3b gene, which suppresses part of our immune response to virus infections. One particular variant of orf3b does so more effectively than the original, which may give the virus more time to replicate in the absence of an effective immune response. A sicker patient may be the result.

As of this week, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 7.6 million people. That's remarkable for a virus that very likely began with the infection of a single person roughly six months ago. SARS-CoV-2 has now had seven million more chances to adapt to its new human ecosystem, and there are hints that the virus is doing a good job of it.

We know from our experience with many viruses like HIV-1 and influenza, that we are not facing a static foe. The novel coronavirus is changing, as we struggle to control the pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 has already proven to be a formidable adversary. While our success today -- though arguably limited -- is important, we should not lose sight of the long battle against microbe that lies ahead.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/12/opinions/coronavirus-mutation-increased-infectivity-haseltine/index.html,3
3,"Michael D'Antonio is the author of the book ""Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success"" and co-author with Peter Eisner of ""The Shadow President: The Truth About Mike Pence."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) The leaking ship that is the Trump presidency has a hole in its hull the size of the 38% job-approval rating reported by CNN. Add a gash as big as the 16.4% (including misclassified workers) unemployment rate and it's easy to see why some prominent Republicans are stepping away from a leader who has suddenly been transformed from a fearsome Twitter monster into the man mocked as "" Bunker Boy .""

Former President George W. Bush and Sens. Mitt Romney, Republican stalwarts, won't support his re-election. Other GOPers, like former House Speakers Paul Ryan and John Boehner, have not indicated where they stand while Sen. Lisa Murkowski is "" struggling "" with the decision.

With a schism forming, the time is ripe for a high-level official to make the dramatic break that would signal that someone is ready to stand as the leader of the post-Trump Republican Party. I would nominate for this job, Vice President Mike Pence. Unprecedented? Pretty much. But the Trump era is unprecedented too, and Pence signaled, when he agreed that he would be Trump's running mate, that he's willing to do the unexpected.

At this point, as President Trump's support weakens , Pence should weigh the merits of declaring he won't be vice president for a possible second term. There's an argument that Pence's status in Trumpworld might be endangered anyway. If the President continues to trail Joe Biden by double digits in the polls this summer and if the Democratic contender picks a woman of color for his running mate, he could be tempted to shake up his ticket by selecting Nikki Haley or another candidate for VP. Such a move could bring back some of the white suburban women Trump needs to win re-election and remind everyone that he's not a typical politician.

If we cast our minds back to the distant (feeling) summer of 2016 we can see that Trump was repellent to many mainstream Republican leaders who considered his ugly way of talking and his record of scandal -- many involving allegations of sexual misconduct -- and stood at arm's length. Who would have imagined, then, that a puritanical governor of Indiana who refused to lunch alone with a female colleague and, according to Rolling Stone, called his wife "" mother ,"" would harness himself to the thrice-married often-bankrupted Trump?

Although others were confused when Pence made his fateful decision, it affirmed what many Hoosiers long knew: Behind that mild-mannered persona lurks a savvy and opportunistic politician. Pence was, at the time when Trump came calling, a not-so-popular governor of a mid-sized state with grand ambitions. (As reported in my co-authored biography of Pence, he had first voiced White House dreams as a youngster.)

In addition to his big dreams, Pence possessed a certain knack for understanding how modern Republican politics worked. Two failed runs for Congress in 1988 and 1990 led him to a long stint as a radio and TV personality where he fashioned himself as ""Rush Limbaugh on decaf"" or someone who was ""conservative,"" but ""not angry about it.""

As his announcing gigs helped him hone his speaking style, the reactions he heard from listeners and viewers helped him understand the blend of right wing Christianity and conservative politics that could be potently effective in small town and rural America. When he was ready to get back into politics his pro-business stands made him attractive to donor organizations like the Club for Growth , which helped him fill a winning war chest. Later came backing from the deep-pocketed conservative Koch Brothers whose imprimatur almost certainly made like-minded GOP donors take notice of Pence.

Well established as a Christian Right political figure who was an extremely effective fundraiser, the only cloud hovering over Pence in 2016 was at home in Indiana where mistakes and missteps threatened his future. Trump's offer gave him a graceful exit -- far better to move on than be defeated -- and a longshot chance at higher office. The bet paid off.

As veep, Pence has combined abject loyalty and frequent well-timed absences to stay in Trump's good graces while avoiding many controversies. He didn't win a truly high-profile assignment until, after the administration's big early mistakes were made, he was named head of the Coronavirus Task Force . He's distinguished himself from Trump by speaking calmly, getting along with the nation's governors, and working hard. And by ceding center stage whenever the President wanted it, he also avoided becoming the focus of critics.

Last week, as the country erupted in protests following the death of George Floyd, Pence was not present when federal officers brutally cleared away demonstrators and the President walked to St. John's Church and wordlessly hoisted a Bible to signify something about his leadership. Pence was also absent when, on the next day, Trump performed a similar display at the Saint John Paul II National Shrine.

The pandemic and tide of anti-racism sentiment has revealed the limitations of the President as a leader and of his law-and-order posturing. With the election less than five months away, Trump is in grave danger of losing his bid for a second term. This may be why, weeks ago, the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee urged its candidates to, for their own good, limit the praise they heap on the incumbent.

With party stalwart Colin Powell announcing he will support Trump's opponent Joe Biden, and many others reportedly leaning that way, an opening is available for someone with a keen sense of where the political winds blow, a strong instinct for self-advancement, resources of his own and a proven willingness to surprise.

Conditions are perfect, in other words, for Mike Pence to observe that either he needs to spend more time with his family or believes the President would benefit from the excitement that would come were he to run with a fresh face -- perhaps former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley -- beside him. Pence could resign, saying Trump is just too loyal to fire him, and graciously make a path for himself to become the new leader of the GOP come the defeat of the Trump-Haley ticket in November.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/11/opinions/time-pence-jump-ship-opinion-dantonio/index.html,3
3,"Does marijuana cause psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, and do associated symptoms like paranoia lead to violent crimes? That’s what writer Alex Berenson is claiming. As part of his new book promotion, Berenson published a New York Times op-ed that also blames the drug for “sharp increases in murders and aggravated assaults” purportedly observed in some states that allow adult recreational marijuana use.

As scientists with a combined 70-plus years of drug education and research on psychoactive substances, we find Berenson’s assertions to be misinformed and reckless.

It is true that people diagnosed with psychosis are more likely to report current or prior use of marijuana than people without psychosis. The easy conclusion to draw from that is that marijuana use caused an increased risk of psychosis, and it is that easy answer that Berenson has seized upon. However, this ignores evidence that psychotic behavior is also associated with higher rates of tobacco use, and with the use of stimulants and opioids. Do all these things “cause” psychosis, or is there another, more likely answer? In our many decades of college teaching, one of the most important things we have tried to impart to our students is the distinction between correlation (two things are statistically associated) and causation (one thing causes another). For example, the wearing of light clothing is more likely during the same months as higher sales of ice-cream, but we do not believe that either causes the other.

In our extensive 2016 review of the literature we concluded that those individuals who are susceptible to developing psychosis (which usually does not appear until around the age of 20) are also susceptible to other forms of problem behavior, including poor school performance, lying, stealing and early and heavy use of various substances, including marijuana. Many of these behaviors appear earlier in development, but the fact that one thing occurs before another also is not proof of causation. (One of the standard logical fallacies taught in logic classes: after this, therefore because of this.) It is also worth noting that 10-fold increases in marijuana use in the UK from the 1970s to the 2000s were not associated with an increase in rates of psychosis over this same period, further evidence that changes in cannabis use in the general population are unlikely to contribute to changes in psychosis.

Evidence from research tells us that aggression and violence are highly unlikely outcomes of marijuana use. Based on our own laboratory research, during which we have given thousands of doses of marijuana to people – carefully studying their brain, behavioral, cognitive and social responses – we have never seen a research participant become violent or aggressive while under the influence of the drug, as Berenson alleges. The main effects of smoking marijuana are contentment, relaxation, sedation, euphoria and increased hunger. Still, very high THC concentrations can cause mild paranoia, visual and/or auditory distortions, but even these effects are rare and usually seen only in very inexperienced users.

There is a broader point that needs to be made. In the 1930s, numerous media reports exaggerated the connection between marijuana use by black people and violent crimes. During congressional hearings concerning regulation of the drug, Harry J Anslinger, commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, declared: “Marijuana is the most violence-causing drug in the history of mankind.” He was compelling. But unfortunately, these fabrications were used to justify racial discrimination and to facilitate passage of the Marijuana Tax Act in 1937, which essentially banned the drug. As we see, the reefer madness rhetoric of the past has not just evaporated; it continued and has evolved, reinventing itself perhaps even more powerfully today.

There have been several recent cases during which police officers cited the fictitious dangers posed by cannabis to justify their deadly actions. Philando Castile, of St Paul, Minnesota, in 2016; Michael Brown, of Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014; and Keith Lamont Scott, of Charlotte, North Carolina, in 2016 were all killed by police who used some version of this bogus defense.

Ramarley Graham, Trayvon Martin, Rumain Brisbon and Sandra Bland all also had their lives cut short as a result of an interaction with law enforcement (or a proxy) initiated under the pretense of marijuana use suspicion.

Back in the 1930s, when there were virtually no scientific data on marijuana, ignorant and racist officials publicized exaggerated anecdotal accounts of its harms and were believed. Almost 90 years and hundreds of studies later, there is no excuse for these exaggerations or the inappropriate conclusions drawn by Berenson. Neither account has any place in serious discussions of science or public policy – which means Berenson doesn’t, either.

3,"So IBM has seen the light on facial recognition technology. On Monday, in a dramatic and surprisingly passionate statement (at least for the CEO of a major tech company), Arvind Krishna called on the US Congress to enact reforms to advance racial justice and combat systemic racism, while announcing that his company was getting out of the facial recognition business.

In his letter, Mr Krishna said that “IBM no longer offers general-purpose IBM facial recognition or analysis software” and “firmly opposes and will not condone uses of any technology, including facial recognition technology offered by other vendors, for mass surveillance, racial profiling, violations of basic human rights and freedoms, or any purpose which is not consistent with our values and principles of trust and transparency. We believe now is the time to begin a national dialogue on whether and how facial recognition technology should be employed by domestic law enforcement agencies.”

Amen to that. No sooner had the letter been released than cynics and sceptics were poring over it for the get-out clause. IBM was never a big player in the facial recognition game, said some, and so it’s no sacrifice to exit it: to them, Krishna’s letter was just “virtue- signalling”. Yet two days later Amazon heard the signal and announced a one-year suspension of police force use of its Rekognition facial recognition software – they say they’d like Congress to pass stronger regulation around it.

The IBM announcement and now Amazon’s are a big deal. Just ponder their significance for a moment: two major tech companies have declared that a technology that its industry (and governments of all stripes, everywhere) regards as the biggest thing since, well, internet search, is toxic. This is still news to the evangelists of machine learning, and maybe also to many police authorities and government ministers, but it will come as no surprise to regular readers of this column. I wrote about it just over a year ago, for example, citing a startling essay by Luke Stark, a Microsoft researcher, who called facial recognition “the plutonium of AI”. The technology, he said, was “dangerous, racialising, and has few legitimate uses; facial recognition needs regulation and control on par with nuclear waste”.

To date, that warning (often echoed by other concerned experts) has fallen on deaf ears. Or, more accurately, on ears that do not want to hear it. For them, there’s too much revenue in this to entertain doubts about societal damage. The commercial and governmental worlds have been salivating at the potential of facial recognition technology. Shops want to be able to identify customers in real time as they come through the door. Firms want it to make sure that only authorised personnel enter offices. Universities and schools want it to track student attendance at classes. Police forces want it to increase the effectiveness of stop-and-search operations. And on top of everything else, there’s the geopolitical angle: China is using the technology everywhere and the preservation of US hegemony depends on us getting on top of it before Chinese tech sweeps the world market. It’s Huawei on steroids, in other words.

From the outset, it was obvious that digital technology enabled surveillance of astonishing comprehensiveness. If anyone doubted that, then Edward Snowden removed all grounds for doubt in 2013. But real-time facial recognition is the most toxic manifestation to date of the technology’s dystopian potential, because it finally closes the loop. For if surveillance is to be really effective, it must enable tangible (re)action.

It’s not just enough for people to fear that they are perpetually being watched, in other words; it’s when the watchers have the capability for automated instant reaction that the penny drops for the watched. This capability is already being deployed in China. Cameras scan pedestrian crossings and roadways looking for jaywalkers. When transgressors are spotted, they are instantly identified by name and their images are displayed on large screens in the street. From there it’s a small step to also make a deduction from their “social credit” scores or issue a fine.

As I write this, I can hear the standard response of tech evangelists to criticism: technology is neither good not bad – it all depends on how it’s used. And that’s at least an arguable proposition. What makes facial recognition interesting, though, is that it may be an exception to that rule, a technology that is so toxic that it should be generally illegal and only deployed in tightly controlled circumstances. In that sense, it should be treated like we treat plutonium. And just as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence decides which medicines and techniques should be available in the NHS, our societies now need an equivalent body to decide whether technologies such as facial recognition should be deployed and under what circumstances. And sometimes, such a body will just have to say “no”.

3,"We must correct decades of conventional 'wisdom' about what the economy needs or is. Letting financial markets reign won't help us now or in the future.

April and May were incredible months for the stock market, which has increased 30% since its March lows. April and May were also horrific months for workers, with 37.2 million filing for unemployment, the most on record for a two month period. That both of these statements are true offers real insight into what our economy is, who it works for, and what policies should be adopted to help it thrive.

If you ask President Donald Trump about this, he’ll give you a pretty clear answer. In response to the news Friday that the unemployment rate in May was only 13.3%, which is well above its Great Recession peak and reflects tens of millions of Americans unemployed and underemployed, the president tweeted that “It’s a stupendous number. It’s joyous, let’s call it like it is. The Market was right. It’s stunning!”

His line of reasoning isn’t new. Even before the current public health and economic disasters, Trump touted the strength of the economy and cited the S&P 500 as proof. And long before the current presidency, conservatives have argued that the best signs of a strong and healthy economy are high stock prices and corporate profits.

But if you ask pretty much anyone else across the country, you’ll hear a different perspective. Over the past two months, more than 37 million people have filed for unemployment and millions more have seen their hours cut (or have had to drop out of the workforce altogether). The unemployment rate in May for black people increased to 16.8%. Permanent job losses actually increased in May by almost 300,000, and since February, the economy has lost over 1 million permanent jobs. Some economists have estimated that the true overall unemployment rate for April was high as 34%. GDP — while not the most complete or representative measure of the economy — is expected to shrink as much as a cataclysmic 30% in the second quarter.

Frontline workers will tell you that they lack decent pay and safe working conditions. State and local governments are clamoring for resources as tax revenue dries up. The vast majority of small businesses have found themselves shut out of relief, for lack of an existing relationship with the big banks acting as the gatekeepers for loans. And millions upon millions of families are worried every night about how they will make it through the next day.

Clearly, for most people, the economy isn’t doing very well at all.

So, which is it? Is the stock market really the best assessment of the economy’s overall strength and potential, or is it fully divorced from the real economy that the vast majority of Americans experience day in and day out?

The stock market could hardly be a worse indicator for how the U.S. economy is actually doing. Focusing on the bottom lines of publicly-traded companies and the gross wealth hoarded by those at the top is not just an inaccurate way to measure our economy — a fact that should be obvious at this point — but it’s also a dangerous distraction from the steps the government must take to support the real economy: people.

Risks in reopening America: Coronavirus doesn't care about public opinion and it still kills

To start, it’s helpful to examine who actually benefits from a strong stock market. The wealthiest 10% of Americans own 84% of stocks. Half of American families don’t have a penny invested in the stock market, and that includes 401Ks and other retirement savings. This is even lower among communities of color, with only 36% of Black families and 37% of Latin families owning stock.

Regardless of this shareholder breakdown, conservatives will say that high stock profits mean business executives can reinvest their gains into their workers. And yet, the wealth of billionaires in the U.S. increased by $282 billion in just three weeks when the market rallied in April — even as 22 million people filed unemployment claims in that same time.

CEOs waxed poetic about the health and safety of their employees as they laid off thousands of workers, only to turn around and dole out hundreds of millions of dollars in dividends to their shareholders. Plain and simple, stock market increases and corporate bailouts further concentrate power and wealth into the hands of the few, away from workers and families.

Coronavirus unemployment benefits: Extensions should turn off only when economy recovers

Given that President Trump also stacked his “reopening the economy” council with dozens of Fortune 500 CEOs, it should come as no surprise that he and his allies in the Senate have primarily focused not on keeping people safe and providing relief, but on shielding companies from liability as they bring employees back to unsafe work conditions. The people closest to the Trump administration represent those who stand to gain the most from a booming stock market. It’s no wonder, then, that the president throws his weight behind policies expedient for the market and disastrous for millions of Americans’ health and stability.

The fallacy that financial markets are how to define economic success is exactly what got us where we are today: rampant inequality, a frayed safety net, and a middle-class teetering on the edge of disaster. It’s imperative that we correct decades of the conventional “wisdom” of what the economy needs, or what the economy is. Continuing to prioritize, even rely on, the reign of financial markets will not only not get us out of this — it will leave us far worse off for the future.

3,"The coronavirus and the George Floyd killing showed that letting problems fester makes them much worse. Let's not do the same with distance learning.

When historians look back at 2020, they might see some important lessons about how problems become really big problems when left to fester.

First, COVID-19 shut down the American economy and killed over 112,000 Americans — disproportionately African American — because we failed to establish the proper public health response early to address it.

Then, intense national protests erupted in every major city because of our persistent inability to address systemic racism, which manifested itself this time in the brutal police killing of George Floyd.

Problems don’t go away if we try to sweep them under the rug. They just get worse.

Another crisis now looms. Since tens of millions of Americans began sheltering in place in March, the nation’s schools have switched to remote learning. Many teachers, students and parents were unprepared for distance learning, which could become a permanent fixture of education. And once again, communities of color will be the most severely affected.

The majority of teachers, many of whom came of age before smartphones and social media, admit they’re not ready for this transition from in-person to online education. Huge numbers of children are being left out and left behind. Nationally, fewer than half the nation’s public school students have been participating in online classes; some studies report that 75% of students lack sufficient digital proficiency necessary for remote learning. In Philadelphia, after two-and-a-half months of remote learning, only 61% were taking part in classes on an average day, although pre-pandemic attendance was above 90%.

A number of sociological problems are being ignored as the nation tries to fumble its way into distance education. Single parents are striving to support their families on poverty wages while encouraging their children’s education. Too many parents and children are struggling to attain basic literacy and numeracy as well as digital literacy. And many curricula don’t address African Americans, Hispanics and other communities of color, as well as digitally native young people from every background.

For their part, while students report great interest in the digital world and spend lots of screen-time on entertainment, information, and social media, huge numbers still report online education as wholly uninteresting.

As recent events underscore, racial and economic injustices underlie educational equalities, especially during this digital transition. Almost 40% of African American and Hispanic households don’t have computers at home for their children to participate in online classes, do research on the internet and complete and submit their homework.

While broadband is available in 95% of homes, only 73% of households subscribe. An Obama administration study in 2015 found that most non-subscribers to residential broadband don’t see its relevance. How have our education and civic communities responded to that? By sweeping it under the rug.

Joe Biden: We must urgently root out systemic racism, from policing to housing to opportunity

Many broadband providers are doing their part with $10-a-month service, but the nation needs to do more to achieve universal access and adoption, especially at this moment of turmoil and transition.

In rural areas where so many communities are suffering social isolation and economic dislocation, about 22% of the residents don’t have wireline, and past efforts at extending broadband failed because of waste and political patronage.

As terrifying as these times are, America has been there before. In 1967, amidst urban upheavals, President Johnson created the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders. After the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King a year later, America should have heeded the report’s prophetic conclusion that the nation was moving toward “two societies, separate and unequal.” But Congress hit the snooze button instead.

Now we need a similar commission on education and equality — and how we can transition education to a digital future that doesn’t reinforce the “savage inequalities” of our past and present. No leader, no institution and no single solution can eliminate educational inequalities in the digital era. But together — educators, policymakers, parents and business, civic and religious leaders — can and must make a difference.

Sticker shock: Is an elite college worth the price if it's online? Or at all?

For starters, we should adopt recommendations from the American Federation of Teachers Plan to Safely Reopen American Schools and Communities, which calls for increased investment to close the digital divide. As the report explains, high speed broadband, reliable mobile service, modern technology and hardware are no longer optional — they are now core infrastructure needs of businesses, schools and homes.

Seeing what has happened these past few months to our schools and in our streets, we dare not falter or fail.

3,"One of the biggest threats facing America today isn't beyond the water's edge. It's censorship spreading like a wildfire coast to coast and it’s a perilous endangerment to free speech, a free press and artistic expression that should alarm every American – I don't care how you vote.

It's well-known that Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other social media platforms are silencing political speech and any content they simply don't like. These platforms, run by unchecked far-left and liberal activists, are brazenly muting elected officials – including the president, members of Congress and other high-profile conservatives across industries.

The social media companies are even censoring reports from global health experts, mainstream media and countless others whose First Amendment rights are being flagrantly violated – with zero accountability.

SNAP CEO: WE'RE USING OUR FREE-SPEECH RIGHTS BY LIMITING TRUMP'S CONTENT

Take Facebook. On Monday, the World Health Organization sent shockwaves through the media echo chamber when one of its top epidemiologists said at a press conference that asymptomatic spread of the coronavirus is ""very rare.""

Many outlets covered this important revelation and quoted Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove's statements, as they should – it's their job to report on such things. But when I posted a link to a CNBC article about it, Facebook blocked it. The social network ""fact-checked"" my post saying it was ""Partly False Information"" and threatened to take action if I share the article again.

The notice warned: ""False Information In This Post. Pages and websites that repeatedly publish or share false news will see their overall distribution reduced and be restricted in other ways.""

In other words, Facebook admitted to a deceptive practice known as shadow banning, where user posts are blocked from appearing in their followers' feeds. This is something conservatives – including me – have been sounding the alarm about for years. I testified in 2018 before a congressional hearing about social media censorship titled ""The State of Intellectual Freedom in America.""

For years, many of my social media followers have reported they don't see my conservative opinion columns and posts in their feeds. My nationally syndicated column gets heavy traction everywhere except when I post it on Twitter and Facebook.

This is not an isolated anecdote, by any means; it's part of a pervasive pattern of censorship. Scores of other high-profile conservatives – including national TV hosts, lawmakers such as Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio; Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif.; and tens of thousands of Trump supporters – have reported similar censorship by these almighty platforms.

But make no mistake. The rampant censorship we're seeing isn't limited to Big Tech censoring conservative voices -- far from it.

3,"The challenge in contemporary times, in light of meeting restrictions and financial loss, is deciding how we can most effectively create and cultivate those relationships.

Given the technology currently available, can we afford to cut costs by meeting online?

Or, do the overall, long-term social costs outweigh any financial gain?

Saving Money on Travel Might Cost You Business

A study published by Forbes in its Insights section over a decade ago surveyed 760 business executives, revealing some significant truths remaining evident today.

Even when faced with dwindling travel budgets, the consensus was that face-to-face meetings are more than preferable, they are necessary to cultivate deeper, more profitable bonds with both business partners and clients.

From an internal perspective, they also agreed that bonding in-house means in-person: they believe that face to face meetings are best for maintaining productive relationships with co-workers.

Most people feel the same way today — despite modern advances in online meeting technology. The important question, as it relates to opportunities for business development, is why.

Here are three reasons:

In a professional setting, the Forbes article notes that meeting ""down"" time is time well spent bonding with colleagues and clients.

We do the same thing today.

The majority of in-person meetings include at least continental breakfast and coffee service. These periodic breaks, built into the agenda, afford more than physical sustenance; they allow us to nurture interpersonal bonds as well.

Foexample, on Zoom, companies are cutting costs of conference rooms and catering, but at the expense of connection and conversation. Unlike the ""meet and greet""/ mingling periods naturally built in to in-person meetings, there is no break time in a Zoom room.

Sure, hosts can open a zoom room early, but good luck forming personal connections in front of a group of people — many who might be total strangers, depending on the size and scope of your meeting.

Additionally, on a virtual platform, there are no side conversations or meaningful opportunities to dialog one-on-one with others, which can be frustrating when in a virtual meeting with others you would love to meet in real life.

Even breakout rooms usually do not facilitate one-on-one conversations.

Sure, there is the chat-box, but half of the participants do not know it’s there or are too busy multitasking to use it. Not to mention the fact that many hosts disable it all together to ensure full attention is paid to the program and speakers.

2.) Why We Shouldn't Discount the Significance of Small Talk

We recognize the value of conversation content as well. Because everyone knows, not all business conversation is about business.

Rene Shimada Siegel in INC. aptly writes in ""5 Reasons You Need to Meet in Person,"" and captures a concept we can all relate to as a crucial component of in-person meetings: the value of what Siegel refers to as ""not-so-small talk.""

Siegel notes that in contrast to business conversations, which focus on problem solving, business relationships are forged through getting to know one another — which is more easily done in person.

Also, as a practical matter, in terms of the topics that come up during business meeting mingling, we acknowledge the difference between substantive and social, but which is more rewarding interpersonally?

As soon as you identify common ground, sharing memories and stories will outshine talking shop any day.

Ironically, it is often these light conversations that produce strong, business relationships.

3.) Let's Discuss Divided Attention: Can We Overcome It?

Despite our best intentions, it is virtually (no pun intended) impossible to sit stiffly at attention for hours on end staring into your computer camera. Instead, chances are, as time goes by, you will either drift off mentally, or multitask.

And remember, you are not fooling anyone when you turn off your camera.

Other participants can relate to this temptation to take a breather. Virtual meetings do not lend themselves to breaks; it is hard enough getting everyone logged on correctly to begin with.

The bad news here, is that in all settings, from the personal to the professional, we build chemistry and rapport through attention. And on platforms like Zoom, divided attention is an overstatement; inattention is probably more accurate, and perhaps more likely as long meetings get even longer.

Do Supplement the Virtual With the Personal

Whether you are meeting new colleagues virtually or attending an online professional networking event, consider following up your virtual meeting with a real one. You might not ""click"" in a Zoom room the way you can in a boardroom, but you can make the most of both venues. Because the best business relationships are personal.

5,"The new rule defines “sex” to mean biological sex for the purposes of Obamacare’s nondiscrimination policy.

The Department of Health and Human Services has just announced a rule undoing an Obama-administration policy that had redefined “sex” to include “gender identity” and “termination of pregnancy” for purposes of nondiscrimination under the Affordable Care Act.

Section 1557 of Obamacare prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability in health-related programs or activities. Near the end of President Obama’s second term, his HHS Department released a regulation redefining “sex” for the purposes of Section 1557 to include “gender identity” and “termination of pregnancy.”

As a result of the rule that HHS released today, that regulation has been reversed and “sex” once again refers only to biological sex, as was intended in the statute.

In December 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas enjoined Section 1557’s prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of gender identity and termination of pregnancy. Last fall, the same federal judge vacated the rule, saying that it violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

As a result of these rulings, HHS no longer could enforce the Obama-era provision, and today’s new rule brings federal policy into compliance with court rulings.

“What this regulatory reform does is update the books to reflect the reality that ‘gender identity’ and ‘termination of pregnancy’ have been deemed unlawful interpretations of civil-rights law,” Roger Severino, director of the HHS Office for Civil Rights, told National Review. “This final rule is merely conforming to that legal reality.”

Severino noted, too, that the new HHS rule “carries forward the Obama administration’s decision not to include ‘sexual orientation’ as a protected category under the definition of sex discrimination.” Some progressive advocates had urged the Obama-era HHS to add “sexual orientation” to its regulation, but it failed to do so.

Opponents of the Obama administration’s regulation had both health-care and religious-freedom concerns about its implications. Because the policy applied to any health programs or activities funded or administered by HHS, as well as any plans offered in Obamacare’s health-insurance marketplaces, it affected a huge number of health-care providers in the U.S.

By redefining “sex,” the policy required medical professionals to treat biological males who identify as women, and biological women who identify as men, according to their gender identity rather than their biological sex — a practice that can lead to improper health-care decisions.

There was, for instance, a documented case in which a biological female who identified as a male visited a hospital complaining of abdominal pain. Because the doctors were required to treat this person according to gender identity, this biological woman, who was unknowingly pregnant, ended up delivering a stillborn child.

“We agree with the court’s rationale that the plain original meaning of ‘sex’ under our sex-discrimination laws referred to the biological realities of sex, and this is particularly important for programs administered or funded by HHS, because we so often deal with the scientific reality of sex in our health and research programs,” Severino explained.

As the federal judge determined, the Obama policy also had negative implications for religious-liberty and conscience rights, particularly for health-care workers.

“There were religious-freedom concerns at play, as well as to the ability of doctors to be able to act according to their best medical judgment, as well as their conscience and religious beliefs,” Severino said.

The decision to reverse the Obama-administration regulation will almost certainly be met with fury by progressive activists and their allies in the media. When it first became public that the Trump administration was considering undoing the Section 1557 rule, the New York Times falsely asserted that “‘Transgender’ Could Be Defined Out of Existence Under Trump Administration.”

Nevertheless, the move fulfills a key promise that Trump made both on the campaign trail and throughout his time in office, voicing support for undoing Obama-era policies that redefined “sex” to include “sexual orientation” and “gender identity.” This move, though it comes near the end of his first term, is another step in showing his supporters, especially social conservatives, that he is willing to follow through.","https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/06/trump-administration-reverses-obama-era-regulation-that-redefined-sex/,",5
5,"Fox News host Tucker Carlson blasted Twitter and YouTube for censoring content from his program during a Friday night “Tucker Carlson Tonight” monologue.

After playing a “mock tourism ad” the program aired, then shared to Twitter earlier this month, Carlson noted that the social media network “flagged it as ‘potentially sensitive content’ and then they hid it from view.”

“They were saying beware, keep your kids from watching this,” he said. “What’s the justification for warning people of that? We have no idea.”

The Fox News host then told viewers that YouTube also flagged the program’s “half-hour response to nationwide black lives matter riots” with a warning that the content “has been identified by the YouTube community as inappropriate or offensive to some audiences.'”

“By offensive they mean that the left doesn’t like it, and that is the new standard and there’s only one response under that standard, silence the person who disagrees with you,” Carlson said. “That’s why censorship is now everywhere. It’s why the tech companies started censoring the president. It’s why they’re getting more aggressive at silencing you.” (RELATED: PARSCALE: Twitter Censors President Trump But Not Communist China? Something Doesn’t Add Up)

The Daily Caller co-founder speculated that eventually “offensive” content would simply “be erased.”

“It’s digital, it’s not hard to erase it,” he said. “We will never give in, obviously, but the left’s goal is to make dissent invisible and therefore irrelevant. Meanwhile, these same tech companies make it very easy for 12-year-olds to watch hard-core pornography. They have no problem with that at all, but political views they disagree with? No. ‘Gone With The Wind’? ‘Too scary.’ It tells you everything, about what they care about and who they are.”","https://dailycaller.com/2020/06/19/tucker-carlson-twitter-youtube-censorship-dissent/,",5
5,"The movement to topple statues goes against everything America stands for, Black Voices for Trump Advisory Board member David Harris Jr. said Saturday.

“For one, it exposes that the movement was never about black lives. It had nothing whatsoever to do with black lives,” he told Breitbart News at President Trump’s rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

So the fact that this movement now, where they’re defaming statues, they’ve desecrated Abraham Lincoln’s statue, George Washington’s statue, Christopher Columbus statue, Saint Serra, I think it is in San Francisco, that started the first nine missions in California. He’s holding a cross, they yanked it down. It’s anti-Christ, it’s anti-America, it’s anti-everything that is our country, and it’s a Marxist agenda and every single one of them should be thrown in jail.

In San Francisco Friday, protesters pulled down statues of St. Junipero Serra, former President Ulysses S. Grant, and a 131-year-old statue of Francis Scott Key, who wrote “The Star-Spangled Banner,” according to Breitbart News.

Police said about 400 people gathered at the Grant statue that evening to tear it from its base, but no arrests were made.

The movement to topple the monuments had “sucked in the emotions of a lot of Americans, a lot of black Americans, Hispanic, white people, feeling like they’ve got white guilt,” Harris Jr. explained.

You shouldn’t have to feel guilty over the color of your skin. God made each and every one of us and he made us beautiful. If somebody has a problem with your skin color, they need to take it up with the Creator of heaven and Earth, God. Literally, they need to take it up with him. Otherwise, they need to shut their mouths.

“Nobody should feel like they have to be guilty over anything,” Harris Jr. concluded.","https://www.breitbart.com/social-justice/2020/06/20/david-harris-jr-movement-to-tear-down-statues-is-anti-everything-that-is-our-country/,",2
5,"President Donald Trump says Seattle’s Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, a largely police-free community space fashioned amid protests, is run by “domestic terrorists.” Seattle’s police department made (and walked back) a claim about anarchists “extorting” businesses in the area.

But actual businesses around the zone say they’re watching Ava DuVernay films, handing out granola bars, and having a nice time.

Following several nights of showdowns between police and protesters, in which cops made liberal use of tear gas and flash grenades, Seattle reached a detente with activists on June 9. The city would open up a few streets for Black Lives Matter marches in its Capitol Hill neighborhood, and police would evacuate the nearby precinct. With police mostly gone, activists—including a mix of Black Lives Matter organizers, anarchists, and the two groups’ overlap—set up barricades around several blocks and proceeded to turn the interior into a sort of cop-free commune. Local businesses are chipping in with free food and open bathrooms, despite rumors that activists were holding them prisoner in their own beer halls and indie movie theaters.

But the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, or CHAZ as it quickly became known, has inevitably became the focus of conservative hand-wringing. “Domestic Terrorists have taken over Seattle,” Trump tweeted late Wednesday, alongside a demand that state and local officials “take back your city NOW. If you don’t do it, I will. This is not a game. These ugly Anarchists must be stopped IMMEDIATELY. MOVE FAST!” The president has continued to inveigh about the allegedly dangerous project underway there.

Seattle Police circulated their own talking points about the CHAZ. “We’ve heard, anecdotally, reports of citizens and businesses being asked to pay a fee to operate within this area,” Assistant Chief of Police Deanna Nollette said on Wednesday. “This is the crime of extortion. If anyone has been subjected to this, we need them to call 911.”

Not only is that not true, local business owner Gay Gilmore told The Daily Beast, but some businesses are actually opening to protesters for the first time after long closures for COVID-19.

Rumors that “businesses have actually been tithed or taxed by the autonomous zone [are] absurd,” said Gilmore, who co-owns the Optimism Brewing Company with her husband. “No one is doing that there. I have no idea where that idea came from and I'm in contact with lots of the businesses who are in this neighborhood.”

“GSBA and Capitol Hill Business Alliance have also reached out to businesses in the area, and we have found no evidence of this occurring,” the Greater Seattle Business Association tweeted on Thursday.

The few concrete claims of discomfort stem from a Seattle Post-Intelligencer article that cites unnamed businesses worried about safety, and reports of at least one person carrying a gun on the scene. (Washington is an open-carry state, although Seattle banned weapons in an emergency order on May 30.)

The Seattle Times traced the extortion rumors to a fringe Canadian blog that focuses almost pathologically on overheated fears about leftist activists. That article cited unnamed police sources, who allegedly claimed businesses were being extorted. Those claims spread quickly through the right-wing media sphere, until police repeated them on Wednesday, prompting more articles and completing the ouroboros of extortion rumors.

The department appeared to backtrack on those claims Thursday, stating its “anecdotal” reports had come from media and social media.

“That has not happened affirmatively,” Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best said during the Thursday evening press conference. “We haven't had any formal reports of this occurring.”

The zone’s Northwest Film Forum, Northwest Liquor and Wine, and Pel Meni Dumpling Tzar all told Seattle’s Q13 FOX News that businesses were not being extorted.

“I’ve been talking with neighboring businesses and they’re all elated honestly,” a Pel Meni employee told the station. Some businesses told the Seattle Times that their sales had actually improved, since people were placing walk-up orders that didn’t require delivery fees.

“This protest has not hurt us at all,” Brian O'Connor, co-owner of the zone’s Bok a Bok Chicken told the paper, adding that someone gave him a free sandwich when he entered the CHAZ.

Mx. Pucks A’Plenty, a local activist and performer who asked to speak under their performance name, said Capitol Hill is a historically Black and queer neighborhood, and that that history informs locals’ interactions with the CHAZ.

“The people of Capitol Hill have been extremely giving,” Pucks told The Daily Beast. “They have helped provide supplies. They have helped take care of people when they were tear gassed. They had their phones turned on to the police and made sure that people of the world were watching what's happening here in Seattle. And so I think a portion of what we were seeing on, on the Hill right now is this desire to give back to a community that really did support what was happening in it.”

Rancho Bravo, a restaurant in the CHAZ, was hosting a medical tent—even after its trash cans were damaged in the protests, Pucks said. “You have restaurants in the area making food and delivering it to people on the frontline,” they added. “You have the Vermilion [an art gallery and bar], which was storing supplies, giving out supplies.”

Optimism—a large beer hall located just outside the barricaded area—has been closed for months as COVID-19 swept the country.

“The business is in debt,” Gilmore said, adding that they were opening a proper reopening in a few weeks. Even so, she and her colleagues agreed to open the beer hall’s bathrooms for protesters, after seeing them line up for a pair of port-a-potties on the street. “It was the one thing that we could do was to open the bathrooms.”

Her staff has even been volunteering and using the hall’s long tables to collect donations for CHAZ-dwellers, she added.

“I'm looking at three huge tables covered in water bottles and toilet paper rolls and tampons and bandaids and markers to make signs and granola bars and oranges and bananas,” Gilmore said.

CHAZ activists have used those donations to assemble bags of food for the homeless, part of an organic activism program that also includes teach-ins on racial justice and movie screenings at night. Ava DuVernay’s film 13th, which highlights racist underpinnings of America’s criminal justice system, screened Tuesday night.

It’s a radical change from the tear gas and flash bangs that dominated the streets just days ago, and echoes similar mutual aid networks set up in protest flashpoints like Minneapolis. Likewise, local businesses allying themselves with protesters echoed the solidarity on display during past activist waves, including Occupy Wall Street.

“For the past few days, it hasn't [ever] felt safer,” Gilmore said of the neighborhood. “I'm taking the paper down from our windows. We are getting ready to open, now that the police are not here.”

For all the progressive activism, however, Pucks expressed concern that the initial protest—one for Black lives—was being lost in the noise.

“I think the concept in and of itself is amazing and brilliant,” they said, but “I am terrified that [it will] be at the expense of the Black Lives Matter movement. It will be at the expense of getting equity for Black folks, and that will get forgotten again. There’s gotta be a balance and I’m struggling to see that.”

Pucks’ son is Black, autistic, and tall for his age. “My investment in this is that I gave birth to a Black man and I don't want my son to be killed because he's having a bad day or he's having a bad moment,” Pucks said. “That's my place in this fight. I am not in the business of giving birth to black children to bury them.”

Threats like Trump’s, which implied the National Guard or other armed forces might move on the CHAZ, added to concerns about Black lives in the zone.

“Whenever Trump tweets, it’s pretty alarming because we’re watching someone who doesn’t feel like he’s connected to the reality of things that are happening. I read a tweet from him and it’s like the Twilight Zone. It doesn’t feel real,” Pucks said. But, they added, “none of this feels real. Sometimes I feel like, am I in the middle of a fever dream?”","https://www.thedailybeast.com/local-businesses-love-the-domestic-terror-autonomous-zone-in-seattle-actually?ref=home,",2

5,"Win or lose in November, one thing won’t change for Donald Trump: Over the next few years, his company must settle a series of whopping debts. Before the end of a theoretical second term, his company will have to refinance—or, in a far less likely scenario, pay off—nearly a half-billion dollars in loans linked to some of his most prized assets, including Trump Tower. These debts are maturing at a perilous moment for Trump, whose hotels and resorts have been plagued by declining revenues. And that was before the coronavirus pandemic pummeled the hospitality industry in general and the Trump Organization in particular, forcing the full or partial closure of most of its hotel and resort properties.

On financial disclosure forms, Trump has reported holding 14 loans on 12 proper­ties. At least six of those loans, representing about $479 million in debt, are due over the next four years. Some are guaranteed by Trump himself, meaning a creditor could come after his personal—not corporate—­assets if he defaults. If he holds onto the White House, the refinancing of these debts could take his conflicts of interest to absurd new heights. How will the public know if these deals are on the up and up or whether Trump is receiving sweetheart terms from a bank that wants an in with the president? And what might a lender desire in return for helping Trump out of a financial jam?

Trump’s biggest creditor is Deutsche Bank, which in the late 1990s took a gamble on the real estate developer whose history of corporate bankruptcies made him untouchable by most other lenders. Although Trump and the Frankfurt-based bank pulled off several profitable deals, eventually Deutsche’s commercial lending division learned the hard way one reason why other banks considered him persona non grata: If pushed by his creditors on payments, Trump shoves back. In 2008, after he defaulted on a loan for his Chicago hotel and condo development, he filed a multibillion-­dollar suit accusing Deutsche Bank and others of contributing to the recent financial meltdown, which he blamed for his inability to repay the loan.

Nevertheless, Deutsche’s private banking division, which caters to wealthy clientele, continued to lend to Trump, giving him $125 million, spread over two loans, to finance the purchase and renovation of his Doral golf resort in 2012. Both are floating rate loans, meaning the interest rate fluctuates based on market conditions, which lending experts say usually indicates they are interest-only loans. If so, Trump probably hasn’t paid down much if any of the principal and will owe something close to the whole $125 million when the loans come due in 2023.

In 2014, Trump took out a separate floating loan from Deutsche’s private bank to bankroll the development of his luxury hotel in Washington, DC. The balance of this $170 million debt is payable in 2024. That year, Trump will also owe Deutsche between $25 million and $50 million in connection with his Chicago hotel and complex.

Trump has received additional loans from a company named Ladder Capital, a financial firm that specializes in bundling commercial debt into mortgage-backed securities. Companies like Ladder are often lenders of last resort for people and companies that, for one reason or another, have difficulty obtaining money from traditional banks (ahem, Trump). Such firms are willing to take risky bets because they securitize the debt and pass the responsibility for it on to investors. Trump has two Ladder loans due over the next several years: a $100 million interest-only mortgage on Trump Tower and a roughly $13 million loan against Trump Plaza. The Trump Tower loan is up in September 2022.

Trump’s large, interest-only loans are not unusual for big real estate developers, who, unlike your typical homeowner, are not seeking to pay off the mortgage on their properties. It is common for developers to take out new interest-only loans as the old ones come due, in some cases using a property’s rising value to extract more cash. Trump, for example, has long had a mortgage on Trump Tower, never paying it off and periodically increasing the loan’s size when he refinances.

But under present circumstances—with Trump a lightning rod for controversy, the economy faltering, and his company not faring well—it may not be easy for Trump to convince either Deutsche or Ladder to refinance.

Suffering from its own shaky finances and a series of scandals—involving interest-rate rigging, money laundering, and other unsavory practices—Deutsche has experienced a rocky few years. Its ties to Trump have compounded its woes, making it a magnet for subpoenas from congressional committees, as well as a New York City grand jury, seeking Trump’s financial records.

Even before Trump was elected, Deutsche executives soured on the relationship, turning down Trump’s request for a $10 million-plus loan in early 2016, the New York Times reported. They worried, among other things, how it would look if Trump defaulted and the bank had to pursue the assets of the US president. His most recent financial disclosure no longer lists brokerage and savings accounts at Deutsche’s private bank, suggesting he’s no longer a client.

Nancy Wallace, a real estate finance professor at University of California, Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, says the scrutiny that Deutsche Bank has faced may scare off other banks. “I think any bank I can think of in the United States would have exactly the same response: He is toxic. Exposing yourself to that kind of oversight under the current regulatory reality, for lenders who are large enough to provide capital to him, is just a nonstarter.”

Mike Offit, a former Deutsche Bank executive who was one of Trump’s bankers in the 1990s, predicts that if Trump remains in office, Deutsche will give him short-term extensions until he’s out of office. But it won’t do so happily.

“They just have to do the easy thing, which is extend it,” Offit says. “It’s even more trouble if they try to foreclose on the president. Good luck with that. That’s the way they’re going to put themselves back in the news every day.” (Deutsche Bank declined to comment on whether it would extend or refinance Trump’s loans.)

Commercial lending experts say a firm like Ladder Capital, which relies on a more cold-blooded financial calculus, might be more amenable to lending to Trump again. But with his business taking a sharp hit to its revenues for possibly years to come due to the pandemic, Trump might not like the terms, which could be less favorable than those of his original loans. (Ladder did not respond to questions from Mother Jones. Neither did the Trump Organization, the company’s outside ethics adviser, or the White House.)

Kevin Riordan, a longtime real estate finance executive and director of Rutgers University’s Center for Real Estate, says that Ladder prospered in its previous dealings with Trump—but he notes that the economics have changed. Ladder and its competitors in the commercial mortgage-backed securities (cmbs) industry can only lend if there’s a market for real estate bonds, which could dry up during a financial crisis. “This is a whole different ballgame today,” he says. He adds that in recent years the cmbs industry largely ceased financing golf courses—because they are seasonal businesses, they are not considered a safe bet.

“The world has changed a lot since 2012, and I think the Trump Organization is ill-suited for this new world,” Wallace says. “That’s not to say there’s not some private equity firm out there that would be very tempted if he was willing to pay a very high coupon.”

Private equity firms specialize in taking advantage of bad situations—buying proper­ties and debt that most Wall Street firms won’t touch. It’s not that they’re unaware of the risks; the terms of the deals they strike are often designed to ensure they get their money back, one way or another. And they will not hesitate to come after a delinquent borrower—perhaps even a president.

“There are so many opportunistic lenders out there. All of them would do this stuff,” Offit says, noting that hedge funds might also do business with Trump. “They would lend to Ted Bundy. They don’t care.”

In any scenario, Trump’s soon-to-be-due loans are an unprecedented ethical minefield, rife with potential conflicts of interest and the possibility of corruption. “It’s highly disconcerting,” says Virginia Canter, chief ethics counsel at the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and a former ethics lawyer at the Treasury Department and Securities and Exchange Commission. “I’m sure in some ways the best thing that could happen is that he not win reelection.”",https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/06/donald-trump-loans-deutsche-bank/,1

At a press conference, the Speaker of the House held up a Bible and then ripped it in two, declaring that she was against anything Trump was associated with.

""If Trump is for the Bible, then I am against it,"" she said as she struggled to rip the Bible in half.

7,"JOINT BASE LEWIS-McCHORD, Wash. — Meet Tracker, a five-year-old, sixty-pound Belgian Malinois and a graduate of the Military Working Dog School at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. He’s also one of the Army’s first five openly transgender military police dogs, assigned to the 42nd Military Police Brigade at Joint Base Lewis-McChord.

“We took to each other pretty quickly,” said Spc. Jeffrey Grassley, a military policeman and dog handler partnered with Tracker. “I mean, it’s a little weird that they tell me to call him a ‘him,’ since he’s obviously a female dog, and there was that time last month when he was laid up for a few days after he gave birth to a litter of puppies, but we’ve really forged a close working friendship.”

Tracker, who was raised as a female dog under the name Regina, first identified as a male during the initial breeding and selection process the military uses to screen potential military working dogs.

“Looking back now, it was pretty obvious that she was — sorry, He — was a little different,” said Tech Sgt. Walter Flaherty, one of Tracker’s trainers. “He didn’t really say much, obviously, but you could just sort of tell.”

During play time, Flaherty said, Tracker would consistently engage in behavior normally associated with male dogs, and whenever he would go into heat, would go after the females pretty aggressively, almost totally ignoring the male dogs.

“He would only play with blue chew toys, and for some reason, he really liked watching reruns of ‘Xena: Warrior Princess,'” Flaherty added.

Paws Across The Rainbow, the nation’s leading advocacy group for LGBT animals, hailed the move, calling it a “landmark achievement for all military working animals, no matter what their sexuality.”

“We hope that this will serve as an example throughout the military that being transgendered is simply not a reason to discriminate against competent and talented military working animals of all species, said spokesman Pat Riley, while also calling on the Army to provide no-cost gender-reassignment surgery for the dogs “as a gesture of tolerance and recognition of the diverse nature of today’s military working animals.”

Some of the more traditional, conservative elements within the Army might not be so ready to embrace such a radical change, however.

The all-male caisson horses of the 3rd Infantry Regiment, or “The Old Guard,” long entrusted with the solemn honor of bearing the caskets of fallen warriors and deceased U.S. presidents, have drawn fire for refusing to allow female or openly LGBT horses within its ranks, and the regiment’s command team is unapologetic about that fact.

“As long as I’m here, that’s the way it’s going to stay,” said Command Sgt. Maj. Samuel J. Stoker, The Old Guard’s senior noncommissioned officer. “I’ll resign before I’ll see some fancy-prancing fairy-horsey bear my president down the National Mall.”

Stoker may be the last of a dying breed, however. Polling data suggests that most service members are indifferent to the idea, with 15 percent of those polled say they would “definitely” or “very likely” be willing to work with an openly LGBT military working animal. In that regard, Tracker and his four compatriots are pioneers in more than one way: If all goes well, according to sources within Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel’s office, their service may open the door to full integration for all LGBT military working animals.

As for Spc. Grassley, Tracker’s handler, he says he doesn’t concern himself with the larger political implications of Tracker’s assignment to the unit, and just treats him as his K-9 partner, nothing more.

Now, to ice the cake of Democrat shame, Jordan will be running for the Senate in 2020 — as a Republican.

Jordan is far too classy to respond. He did release a picture of himself wearing his famous Confederate Flag boxer shorts under his basketball uniform at NCU.

7,"Lodi, CA — A Manteca man is lucky to be alive after surviving what aviation experts are calling both a miracle and a freak accident. An expert skydiver, Kent Clostomy, has made over 3000 jumps from his home base of Lodi, CA. Mr. Clostomy is the co-owner of the mal-named skydiving company Deep Impact and decided to make a high jump from close to 20,000 feet over the California Central Valley.

“Kent is the best there is,” said his partner at Deep Impact Carol Dons, also an expert skydiver and the company’s lead instructor. “So when he came in and told me he was going to make what we call a big jump, I didn’t think much about. I was kinda jealous, to be honest.”

The jump started like any other. Mr. Clostomy boarded his company’s twin-engine Cessna “Old Betsky” piloted by long-time Deep Impact employee Steven “Mad Dog” Snarls. The pair boarded aircraft at 9:07 am and proceeded to ascend to the drop altitude.

“Kent is a daredevil, there’s no doubt about that,” said Mr. Snarls. “He wanted me to take it even higher than 20K, but I told him, like I always do, that the FAA will be on our ass if we screw around like that. So I lifted him to 19,256 feet, and he jumped. And I saw the whole damn thing happen.”

Little did either man know that approximately 42 miles away, United Airlines flight 420 had just left San Francisco International Airport on its way towards Salt Lake City. The airplane was climbing to 13,000 feet when the Boeing 737-800 had an unplanned rendezvous with Mr. Clostomy, who was busy screaming his favorite Van Halen song and failed to notice the airplane approaching him at over 300mph to the west.



 “Every time I jump, I put on Hot For Teacher, and then if I have time, I might switch to some ‘Zeppelin,” said an overly tanned and highly enthusiastic Kent recalling his jump. “So I was up there, doing my air drum thing, then wham. The next thing I know, my rig is caught up in the nose of this plane. And I couldn’t get myself free.”

According to pilot Snarls, he was circling back to the Lodi airfield when he says Kent got “snatched up.”

“You have to understand these jets are going fast, and it just came out of nowhere. It just hooked him like a bass in the Delta and poof, and he was gone. I radioed down to Carol, but she thought I was joking. Eventually, she figured it out and got on the horn with the FAA or whatever.”

Recalling his ordeal, Mr. Clostomy seemed unaffected by his unexpected hitchhike on a 737.

“It took me a few minutes to figure out what was going on,” continued Mr. Clostomy. “I’m not too sure, but it was a minute or so. I was caught up underneath the fuselage, you know? I mean, going that fast meant I was pinned up under the plane. I tried banging on the plane. Nothing worked. Finally, I cut myself free and started falling.”





 It was at that point that Kent was somewhere over Eastern Nevada, near Elko, at approximately 25,000 feet.

“It was a bit disorienting at first, but I cured that by cranking up my Van Halen. The reserve [parachute] opened around 8,000 feet, and I coasted into Round Table [Pizza] parking lot out there in Elko. Here’s the thing. No one even noticed. So, I just took off my gear and went in and had a pepperoni pizza and a coke.”

After finishing up his pizza, Mr. Clostomy called Carol and told her he was okay. According to the Deep Impact team, Flight 420 had no idea that they had an additional, unticketed passenger until they arrived in Salt Lake City. The FAA is reviewing its flight plans for the aircraft in the area and is considering limiting skydiving until a new policy is in place.",https://www.gishgallop.com/area-skydiver-caught-by-737-dragged-for-200-miles/,2
7,"Supposedly, Michelle Obama attended both Harvard and Princeton Universities for her degrees before becoming a lawyer and professor. It was bafflement for many on how the former first “lady” obtained such high ranking degrees.

Now the truth is finally coming to light. She didn’t.

Senior Manager of Housing for both universities, Sandy Batts, said in a statement:

“Michelle Obama didn’t technically attend school here. She and Barry held a fundraiser in 1982 that provided both schools with $7 million each. This was years before the scandals of parents buying their kids’ way into school. We, of course, had to just give them the degrees. It was $7 million!!!”

There are a few people that remember Michelle on campus during her fake “tenure” at the schools. They admit that while they did see her going to class and being on the dean’s list, it was obvious that she wasn’t a real student at the Ivy League Schools.

One student who attended Harvard in the 1950s, years before Michelle committed the fraud, said:

“Her transcript clearly listed her as the gender she isn’t. This nullifies all of the work she did during those years. We don’t like liars around these parts — or with those parts.”

The Obamas are laying low, hoping this discrediting of Michelle’s education will just go away.

It’s also been released that she can no longer practice law in nearly all of the states across the country. It’s only a matter of time before her entire law career is over. Ouch, you know that’s got to hurt.",https://obamawatcher.com/2020/03/michelles-fake-degrees/,2
9,"The coronavirus pandemic has irrevocably altered the retail landscape. While traditional channels may rebound to some extent, what's true before COVID-19 is only more critical now: Moving forward, brands must offer customers diverse buying options. In order to build brand loyalty, own the customer experience, and control their destiny, both B2B and B2C brands need to build a strong direct-to-consumer e-commerce channel. Here are five tips for optimizing your company's DTC strategy.

As much pain as the pandemic has caused, it has also created an opportunity for companies to reexamine their e-commerce strategy. Now is the time to do the deeper analysis that's necessary to improve and optimize the business, and most importantly, learn about your customer. In truth, you may not have much choice. With revenue from traditional channels down significantly for many brands, leaders need to find new and better ways to engage customers and drive sales.

In the scramble to shore up declining revenues and engage with new customers quickly, brands might consider pivoting to sell through major online retailers. A retailer can be a great channel to bring your products to market without having to create a fully developed e-commerce destination. However, the current need for these retailers to prioritize shipping essential goods has left many brands without a viable option to get their products to customers.

During the current pandemic and beyond, over-indexing on a third-party retailer means that your shopping experience, delivery process, and even the packaging are all controlled by another company. This means that customers form emotional connections with their brand, not yours. Being able to own that customer experience, control the buying journey, and gather crucial customer data to form new business insights are all reasons why a DTC e-commerce channel is critical for any brand selling in the market today.

For some brands, channel conflict continues to be a concern. But with global e-commerce sales expected to reach $4.5 trillion in 2021, the opportunity presented by direct e-commerce justifies the need to move past that conflict. So, as long as you aren't trying to undercut your retail partners and instead approach your e-commerce strategy as a level playing field, you can largely avoid disrupting important partnerships while capturing new market share.

Remember too that traditional channels will rebound eventually. The landscape may be altered significantly, but they will come back. If you leverage your DTC e-commerce channel effectively, you'll gain valuable customer insights that will empower better shopping experiences through retail partner channels when they return. With omnichannel shopping experiences being the way of the future, the need to move past the fear of channel conflict is essential for long-term success. The truth is, a rising tide lifts all boats.

Focus on what you do well

The best way to execute a successful DTC e-commerce strategy is to concentrate on the areas of your business where you do exceedingly well so you can continue to deliver on your brand promise. You likely have expertise in customer-facing experiences like product positioning, pricing, merchandising, and customer experience. But you may not have as much proficiency in back-office processes like fulfillment, payment processing, regulatory compliance, and tax remittance, especially if you're selling on a global scale. Trying to do everything for your new DTC channel will likely lead to inefficiency, make upgrade paths more difficult, and ultimately slow down your time to market. Choosing reliable partners that have expertise in their space will help you go to market faster.

Speaking of back-office processes, these operations are just as crucial as your e-commerce store UX when it comes to providing outstanding customer experiences. They can also be extremely complex, especially for brands that are new to DTC. For example, transitioning from selling products on wholesale pallets to a single item SKU basis presents a big challenge for accounting and shipping departments. In order to account for economies of scale and compete with major online retailers, brands need to involve in-house accounting, finance, and logistics personnel early in the channel strategy development process. Their buy-in is critical as you look for ways to deliver exceptional customer experiences in your DTC channel.

For brands, a lack of control over the buyer journey can lead to business disruptions. In today's competitive market — one that's been rocked by COVID-19 — such disruptions can be fatal if not approached strategically. Use the current business environment as an opportunity to reassess your e-commerce strategy and build a robust DTC channel. This is the best way to position your company for success now and into the future.

9,"Is the corner office the biggest threat to small and medium-size businesses? As companies shift their business models to mobile technology and remote work, senior executives are surprisingly some of the employees guiltiest of risking their organizations' security.

In fact, according to the 2020 Verizon Mobile Security Index, while 81 percent of executives at small and medium-size businesses surveyed say cyber threats were a moderate to significant risk to their businesses, 39 percent admitted they have sacrificed mobile security to ""get the job done.""

Protections and limits to system access imposed on employees are less frequently imposed on top executives, who are often given wide latitude to use personal devices and to access vast parts of a company's data systems, notes Bryan Sartin, executive director of global security services at Verizon.

Professional services firms have taken a particularly big cybersecurity hit, as they move to an increasingly work-from-home, mobile-business model, often working out of clients' offices and shared workspaces, on public or unsecured wireless networks. The 2020 Verizon Mobile Security Index showed that 66 percent of respondents say they used public Wi-Fi for work tasks, even though one-fourth conceded it was explicitly prohibited by company policy.

""The largest vulnerability for small and medium businesses is that employees generally do not have enterprise-owned devices,"" says T.J. Fox, a senior vice president at Verizon and the president of Verizon Business Markets. ""Without that control, organizations--roughly half of which do not have internal IT resources--are faced with the challenge of protecting assets on devices they don't control.""

Some of the biggest threats to small and medium-size businesses are ransomware and spear phishing attacks. With ransomware, hackers hold a firm's data hostage until money is paid. Spear phishing attacks use emails that already contain some nuggets of personal information lifted from say, a social media post, and are targeted to get an individual to reveal sensitive information including passwords and access codes.

Those stolen username and password combinations are often the foothold needed to access a company network remotely. ""You have a simple email or text click on a handset leading to both personal and company-related theft,"" says Sartin.

""The emergence of ransomware has changed the conversation, and so has the massive shift toward the work from home model,"" adds Fox. ""Ransomware is so widespread, there is now an immediate need for SMBs to adapt their security defenses to better protect their assets.""

According to the 2020 Verizon Mobile Security Index, only 50 percent of small and medium-size businesses restricted access to data on a ""need-to-know"" basis, and 59 percent said they did not take the most basic mobile security precaution: changing manufacturer or vendor-installed passwords on devices.

""Our solutions such as mobile threat defense and secure endpoint protection are affordable and easy to employ and will quickly and effectively help address primary threats,"" says Fox. ""That reduces the likelihood that a compromised device will introduce threats into company systems.""

Ultimately, protecting networks and data from intrusions depends on people, and C-Suite executives need to set an example for the entire team, says Fox. ""Top executives need to create a cyber-aware culture and make it a priority.""",https://www.inc.com/verizon/the-new-security-challenge-for-small-and-medium-businesses-in-the-covid-work-from-home-model-mobile-technology.html,2
9,"A cookbook is more than just a collection of recipes; it’s a piece of history. It sparks memories of joyous occasions around the table with loved ones, and reminds us of moments savoured with family and friends.

To commemorate the 60th anniversary of Canadian cheese producer Tre Stelle, home cooks and chefs across the country were invited become a part of the legacy by sharing their treasured cheese recipes. More than 3,000 submissions were received, confirming that Canadians love their cheese (on average, we consume more than 15 kg each year – and no surprise, that cheddar tops the list of most popular followed closely by feta and mozzarella) – from which 60 recipes (for 60 years) were ultimately selected for inclusion in a new all-cheese cookbook: Say Cheese! 60 Years of Canadians Cooking with Cheese.

With stunning food photography, original recipes, stories, features and tips from professional chefs, Say Cheese! is an indispensable addition for every cheese-lover’s cookbook collection and at the same time, an approachable guide for those recently acquainted with home cooking.",https://nationalpost.com/sponsored/food-drink-sponsored/say-cheese-with-these-treasured-recipes-from-canadian-home-cooks-and-chefs,2
9,"“America is in crisis. Employers say paradoxically they cannot find the right people to fill jobs even though the country is facing its highest unemployment rates in a generation. Competition with a rising China and India and their vast populations lend urgency to the need for the country as a whole to do a better job of educating its citizens.”

The COVID crisis is wreaking havoc with the student experience and higher education institutions around the world. Colleges and universities shifted to remote learning as they were forced to suddenly shut down. Now students and lecturers are anxiously waiting to find out if, when classes resume in September, they will be in person. At some US colleges, students are staging tuition strikes in despair that their degree won’t be considered as valuable under the circumstances.

But we have been here before. The above quote was written in 2010, during the last global economic crisis, by Harvard’s Clayton Christensen. Christensen called for “disruptive innovation” to sweep through American universities, arguing that the business model that brought them to global prestige was becoming fragile. His voice was of many from a wide range of sectors making the case that higher education was in need of a significant transformation.

“The institutions to which the country would turn to help tackle this challenge—its colleges and universities—are facing a crisis of their own,” he wrote. “The institutions are now increasingly beset by financial difficulties, and the recent financial meltdown is but a shadow of what is to come.” Christensen died in January, just as his darkest prediction seemed about to come true.

Higher education had 10 years after the financial crisis to make meaningful reforms. Some, and this in my view was a positive thing on balance, turned to partnering with other institutions. At Qatar Foundation, where I now work, we host branch campuses of some of the best universities in the US and elsewhere, combining best-in-class programs in politics, international relations, media, medicine, business, the arts, and STEM. Such clusters can be found in other places such as Atlanta, where the consortium including Spelman and Morehouse allows students to cross-register for classes and curate their own education, or Amherst where the Five College Consortium offers combined degrees to students at no extra cost. Also, intriguing disruptive innovation in education has been implemented in recent years in institutions which are challenging traditional assumptions and showing results such as O.P. Jindal Global University in India, Arizona State University in USA, University of People, Higher School of Economics in Russia, and even my own Alma Mater, the University of San Luis Potosi in Mexico.

Globally, in recent years, some universities ran experiments with MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) and some offered limited remote online summer classes. Those experiments may have helped many institutions make the nearly overnight switch to remote teaching to enable continuity of learning, but for sure, something that quickly was learned is that those are not permanent solutions. Merely taking an existing course and putting lectures onto Zoom, however, isn’t the kind of fundamental change Christensen was talking about. “Plugging a disruptive innovation into an existing business model never results in transformation of the model,” he wrote in 2011. “Instead, the existing model co-opts the innovation to sustain how it operates.”

Radical ideas for fundamental business model change did emerge. The Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford imagined the “Open Loop University”. Instead of a four-year degree course starting at 18 for a few, six years over a lifetime, where constant acquisition of new skills enable the frequent career pivots people would need. University would be more like a Netflix subscription and less like buying a house.

Beth Akers and Stuart Butler from the Brookings Institution argued that college should come with a “money back guarantee” as a market-based solution to temper skyrocketing costs and student debt. In some countries, income-contingency-loans were enacted as a way to link repayments to future employment. Even in the U.S. some institutions at a certain point offered to repay loans while graduating students would land a job, or to provide them additional free education if no job was available at graduation. Of course, in the midst of the pandemic crisis and the skyrocketing unemployment levels, those promises are gone.

No one tried to seriously build these new business models, however, at least at existing major institutions. Maybe the ideas seemed too fanciful. Or just too hard.

Andrew Yang used his recent presidential campaign as a platform to argue for Universal Basic Income. Automation and AI were about to shred the social contract by destroying the employment prospects of the working and middle class; government would need to provide no-strings cash to individuals for life. Many thought it was fantasy. “The Robot Apocalypse Has Been Postponed”, scoffed Ross Douthat in the New York Times. Just weeks after Yang ended his campaign, the COVID pandemic triggered a global lockdown and economic crash, and UBI became not a sci-fi policy dream but policy in dozens of countries, including the United States.

Crises can make innovations that seemed previously impossible, suddenly inevitable. There will be years of “a reckoning” that higher ed institutions will go through. But the “new normal” we must shape needs to begin with the recognition that putting classes on Zoom isn’t change. Higher ed institutions need reimagining, not just repairing. Educators, policymakers, employers, investors must urgently give thought to what a post-COVID world should look like and what role higher ed institutions must play to make that world a reality.

Qatar Foundation recently sponsored the Economist Intelligence Unit to produce “New Schools of Thought: Innovative models for delivering higher education”. We hope you will read it and join us in thinking about what innovations could look like from as we look beyond the COVID-19 crisis. This time, we in higher ed cannot afford to let the opportunity pass.

9,"Ground and air ambulance service deploys remote patient monitoring solution to screen and monitor employees for COVID-19

Vivify Health, the developer of the nation’s leading connected care platform for remote patient care, announced today it has partnered with the Regional Emergency Medical Services Authority (REMSA) to implement Vivify’s COVID-19 Screening and Monitoring Pathways, enabling both high and low-risk employees to self-screen for COVID-19 at home using their mobile devices.

Vivify designed the COVID-19 Screening Pathway to stop the virulent spread of COVID-19 by providing a user-friendly, at-home screening option. By making the solution available on mobile devices, users can continually upload and update their symptoms, which are monitored remotely by providers; users can also receive regular updates based on current CDC guidelines.

Since partnering with Vivify over the past few months, 340 of REMSA’s 500 employees have voluntarily enrolled to participate in the COVID-19 Screening program, a 68 percent enrollment rate. REMSA has had multiple cases of employees having symptoms of influenza-like illness and were able to monitor and follow them through their recovery using technology.

Through Vivify, the care team is able to catch symptoms early, direct employees to get tested and self-isolate, and provide organizational support to them. REMSA is closely following the guidance issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) whereby employers may screen employees for COVID-19.

“Keeping frontline healthcare workers safe has never been more critical as it is during this pandemic,” said Eric Rock, founder and CEO of Vivify Health. “It is essential for healthcare providers to leverage technology like remote patient monitoring, not only to keep patients safe, but also the essential workers who care for them.”

With the Vivify COVID-19 Screening pathway, employers have the ability to customize the screening pathway with questions that are specific to their workforce, such as, “If you have been in contact with an infected person, did you have adequate PPE?”

For REMSA employees, which include office staff as well as healthcare providers who respond to emergency calls in northern and rural Nevada and northeastern California, the convenience of Vivify’s COVID-19 Pathways allows for easy access to screening and monitoring on a daily basis. This helps REMSA reduce the risk of exposure for already-vulnerable patients and keep infected employees from passing on the virus to others.

“As the largest employer of mobile health care personnel in northern Nevada, REMSA responds to more than 70,000 requests for service every year,” said Markus Dorsey-Hirt, REMSA’s Chief Nursing Officer. “As our community worked to flatten the curve, and now moves through our reopening phases, REMSA has a responsibility to keep our providers and staff healthy and well. Implementing Vivify’s COVID-19 Screening Pathway, provides reassurance to our employees, as well as our patients and first responder colleagues. Our employees have told us that this screening tool helps them feel supported and able to quickly get direction for their questions.”

REMSA is a high-performance, high-value private healthcare organization and emergency medical services agency serving northern Nevada since 1986. We are a private, nonprofit, community-based organization funded only by user fees with no local community tax subsidy. Through an exclusive franchise agreement, REMSA provides Washoe County’s 420,000 residents with 24/7 ALS and ILS ground ambulance services. REMSA encompasses Care Flight, a regional helicopter, airplane and ground critical care transport service; Care Flight also operates Care Flight Ground in Plumas County. REMSA offers a Nevada-licensed, post-secondary educational institution, a state-of-the-art, fully accredited medical 9-1-1 dispatch communications center, a Tactical Emergency Medical Support team and special events EMS teams. REMSA and Care Flight are Always Ready.

Vivify Health is the innovative leader in connected healthcare delivery solutions. The company’s mobile, cloud-based platform powers holistic remote care management through personalized care plans, biometric data monitoring, multi-channel patient education and functionality configured to each patient’s unique needs. Vivify Health serves the nation’s largest and most progressive health systems, healthcare organizations and employers—empowering clinicians to proactively manage the complexities of remote care and catalyzing employee health and productivity with a single-platform solution for all device and digital health data. The comprehensive, content-rich platform and turnkey workflow services enable providers to intuitively scale and maximize value across populations.

9,"Mango is the latest high street store to launch a range of non-medical face masks. (Mango)

Yahoo Lifestyle is committed to finding you the best products at the best prices. We may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page. Pricing and availability are subject to change.

The UK government now advice that non-medical cloth face coverings should be worn in enclosed spaces, such as on public transport, to help defend you from the coronavirus.

While gov.co.uk has provided instructions on how you can make a suitable face covering out of a T-shirt, scarf or bandana from home. You may not feel comfortable, or don’t have the materials needed to create your own.

Therefore, numerous independent sellers and high street stores including ASOS, Anthropologie, Etsy and Just Hype are now creating non-medical face masks.

Popular Spanish clothing brand, Mango, is the latest label to launch its own designs as part of its new ‘face masks and gels’ section.

Currently the label has three styles available: plain black, floral and animal print. Each is made from polyester and has Mango’s ‘MNG’ logo emblazoned in the corner.

Mango’s non-medical masks are reusable for up to 10 washes and allow breathability and filtration.

Unlike other masks, which are created with elastic ear loops, Mango’s have adjustable fabric ear loops so that it’s easier to adapt the mask to your own facial contours.

The designs have been created in a single size suitable for women and men. There will also be three different sizes for children.

With some independent sellers charging up to £25 per mask, Mango’s £12 price tag is one of the more affordable options. Other budget-friendly high street choices include Anthropologie, where you can buy a single mask for £8, or ASOS, who sell two for £12.

The newly uncovered ‘face masks and gels’ section on Mango’s website suggests that there will be many more useful product launches by the brand in the weeks to come.

For a full list of where to buy a face mask or covering online in the UK, as well as how to make your own, this article covers all you need to know.",https://sports.yahoo.com/mango-non-medical-cloth-face-masks-131029466.html,1
9,"After more than two years of dedicated preparation, Toyota Motor Manufacturing West Virginia (TMMWV) produced Toyota’s first hybrid transaxle in North America this previous week.

“Our team has been planning for this new production line for several years, from construction to pilot projects to hiring new employees and countless hours of training,” said Srini Matam, TMMWV president. “Our team members’ dedication to the work they do every day is what makes our products world-class, and we are grateful for the continued support of our parent company, Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC).”

An initial $113 million investment was announced in late 2017 for TMMWV to yearly produce 120,000 hybrid transaxles, which replaces the conventional transmission in hybrid vehicles. The transaxles, built for the Toyota Sienna and Highlander hybrid vehicles, change their power input with either electric power or internal combustion engine depending on driving conditions to achieve the best fuel economy. During the construction, which included a 72,000 square-foot building expansion and new equipment installation, TMC doubled the production capacity in early 2019 to 240,000 yearly and nearly doubled the project investment to $226 million.

“We are proud to add such a significant investment to Toyota West Virginia,” Matam said. “Expanding West Virginia’s production capabilities to hybrid technology solidifies our facility’s role in producing next generation engines and transmissions that will drive the future of Toyota’s advanced mobility technology.”",https://www.automotiveworld.com/news-releases/toyota-west-virginia-rolls-its-first-hybrid-transaxle-off-production-line-represents-226-million-investment-in-the-plant/,2
9,"Press Release: Bowser Administration Announces District Ranked as Fourth Best Bicycling City in the U.S.

(WASHINGTON, DC) — Today, the Bowser Administration and the District Department of Transportation announced that Washington, DC is ranked as the fourth most bikeable city in the nation by industry coalition group PeopleForBikes. The ranking, which is conducted annually, is based on an evaluation of 550 U.S. cities and assesses factors such as ridership level, system safety and bicycling network.

“Under Mayor Bowser’s leadership, we have made incredible strides in expanding the District’s infrastructure for safe cycling and other forms of sustainable transportation,” said DDOT Director Jeff Marootian. “We are thrilled with this national distinction and remain committed to installing more facilities that will make it safer for cyclists, pedestrians, and all roadway users traveling through the District.”

DDOT plans to install an additional 20 miles of protected bike lanes by 2022, adding to the existing 89 miles of bike facilities, including 12 miles of protected bike lanes, built since 2001. The plan is part of Mayor Bowser’s ongoing effort to improve the safety of the multimodal transportation system in the nation’s capital.

DDOT has several major protected bike lane projects currently under construction including:
• Crosstown Protected Bike Lane, which closes a major gap in the existing bicycle network between Columbia Heights and Brookland
• Brentwood Parkway Protected Bike Lane, an important connection between Union Market, New York Avenue, and the 9th Street NE Bridge
• The Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge, which includes protected bike and pedestrian facilities
• The Fort Totten Extension of the Metropolitan Branch Trail, which once complete will add an important segment to the 8-mile shared-use trail that runs from Union Station in the District to Silver Spring, Maryland

Additionally, the District Department of Public Works recently expanded the District’s bike lane enforcement program by mobilizing 26 new Parking Enforcement Officers (PEOs), bringing the total to nearly 300 officers. DPW has also improved the PEO team’s ability to enforce bike lane violations by adding the ability to photograph violators and assess $150 citations.

• Gross Revenue increased 30% to $30.9M from $23.8M in Q2
• Net Revenue increased 30% to $22.1M from $17.0M in Q2
• Adult-use grams and gram equivalents sold increased 42% to 9,338 kg compared to Q2
• Adjusted EBITDA improved to ($4.3M) from ($8.5) in Q2; tracking towards positive adjusted EBITDA in the first half of fiscal 2021
• Announced expanded partnership with Molson Coors to explore US CBD market in Colorado

OTTAWA, June 11, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HEXO Corp. (TSX: ) (“HEXO” or the ""Company"") today reported its financial results for the third quarter fiscal 2020 ended April 30, 2020. All amounts are expressed in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted.

“I’d like to take this opportunity to thank the HEXO team who has worked tirelessly during the COVID 19 pandemic to keep the doors open and ensure the safety of our employees and our customers. We could not do this without you, we recognize and appreciate your efforts. It’s thanks to your hard work that we closed the third quarter delivering on our financial goals, even in the face of adversity,” said Sebastien St-Louis, CEO and co-founder of HEXO.

Gross revenue increased 30% to $30.9M from $23.8M in Q2’20, and from $15.9M in Q3’19. Net revenue increased 30% to $22.1M from $17.0M in Q2’20, and from $13.0M in Q3’19.

Adult-use cannabis gross revenue in Q3’20 increased 30% to $29.8M from $23.0M in Q2’20, and from $14.6M in Q3’19. The primary driver of the increase in sales during the quarter was the increase in sales from Original Stash. Newly launched products such as hash and oil extract drops also contributed to overall adult-use sales growth. Adult use sales volume in Q3’20 increased 42% to 9,338 kg from 6,579 kg sold in Q2’20.

Gross margin before fair value adjustments for Q3’20 increased 7% to $8.8M or 40% of net revenue from sale of goods, compared with $5.7M or 33% in the prior quarter. Increase in gross margin was driven by a decreased production costs through increased efficiencies, automation of packaging activities, and selection of strains which resulted in decreased labour costs. While the Company expect to see fluctuations in gross margins over the next few quarters as new products are introduced and the Belleville facility ramps up, this success demonstrates that HEXO is tracking towards its goal of a 40% gross margin across their product portfolio.

The Company incurred a write down on inventory of $0.2M compared with $16.1M during Q2’20. HEXO has shifted their strains to those in demand by consumers and focused on creating 2.0 products to utilize trim. These internal production gains mean that we have not had to access inferior 3rd party product.

Operating expenses decreased to $26.8M compared with $281.5M in Q2’20, and from $46.9M in Q4’19. Included in operating expenses, are certain expenses which management believes are expenses that are non-recurring or non-cash and related to significant changes in market conditions. Included in these expenses are:
• Restructuring costs – During the quarter the Company incurred restructuring costs in the amount of $0.9M, compared with $0.3M in Q2’20, associated to the rightsizing of operations. These costs are not expected to continue.
• Impairments of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets – In the prior quarter after completing a strategic review of its cultivation capacity, the Company made the decision to list the Niagara facility for sale. As a result of the decision to sell, the Company undertook impairment testing of the facility, its property, plant and equipment, and the intangible assets acquired from Newstrike Brands Ltd. The Company determined that an impairment loss of $138.3M was required in Q2’20, nil in Q3’20.
• Impairment of goodwill – In the prior quarter, the Company recorded an impairment in goodwill of $111.9M, nil in Q3’20.
• Realization of onerous contract – The Company recorded a $3.0M realization as the result of an onerous contract which is currently the subject of litigation in Q2’20, nil in Q3’20.

When normalized for these non-recurring or non-cash expenses related to significant changes in market conditions, the company reports normalized operating expenses of $25.7M compared to $28.1M in Q2’20, and at its highest point of $46.9M in Q4’19. The 9% decrease quarter over quarter is the result of a decrease in legal and professional fees, travel and share based compensation, as the Company continues to reduce previous spending levels to refocus operations on becoming adjusted EBITDA positive. The significant reduction since its peak in Q4’19 is also due to a reduction and refocusing of marketing related expenditures. When normalized for other non-cash expenses the company reports normalized operating expenses of $14.4M compared with $16.1M in Q2’20.

During Q3’20, the Company’s calculated adjusted EBITDA increased to ($4.3M), compared with ($8.5M). This represents a 50% increase. The Company remains focused on achieving positive adjusted EBITDA in the first half of fiscal 2021, dependent on the implication of COVID 19 on operations, store roll outs and customer demand.

On April 15th, 2020 Molson Coors and HEXO announced the formation of joint venture to explore opportunities for non-alcohol hemp derived CBD beverages in Colorado.

On May 21, 2020 HEXO closed a $57.5M underwritten public offering for the purchase and sale of 55,600,000 units and 8,340,000 over-allotment units. Each unit is comprised of one common share and one-half common share purchase warrant at an offering price of $0.90 per unit. The warrants have a five year-term and an exercise price of $1.05 per share.



On June 1st, 2020 HEXO announced it had obtained its Health Canada license amendment for the sale of dried and fresh cannabis, cannabis extracts, cannabis topicals and edible cannabis products for its cannabis manufacturing and processing facility in Belleville, Ontario. This license amendment also encompasses the expansion of the licensed area to include the beverage production area dedicated to the Truss/HEXO beverage division. This license amendment will allow the Company to achieve greater economies of scale, expand roll out of 2.0 products and continue on its national expansion strategy.



On June 3rd, 2020 HEXO announced the launch of a new 30 gram medical flower format for its popular high-THC strain, Tsunami, to HEXO’s medical clients.

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, authority has been relegated to provincial and territorial governments to determine if the sale of cannabis will be deemed as an essential service and under which mediums (instore and/or online) cannabis may be sold. The various provinces have taken different approaches but the consumer’s ability to access legal cannabis has been maintained. As a trend, the marketplace has seen an overall increase in the sales during the month of March due to stockpiling, but there has also been an increase in consumer spending on recreational activities that can be enjoyed in the comfort of their homes.

Our company’s ability to meet the increase in demand would not have been possible without the dedication of the entire team at HEXO. The company has implemented rigorous safety protocols to mitigate the potential exposure and provide as safe a work environment as possible. Our team members have demonstrated incredible resolve to ensure we continue to execute at the highest levels and achieve operational excellence. We remain vigilant and will continue to proceed with caution.

While we continue to operate during a pandemic, we continue to be cautious about future expectations. Our plans to achieve Adj. EBITDA positive in the first half of fiscal 2021 will depend on the growth of retail stores in our two largest markets, Ontario and Quebec. It is difficult to determine the timing of new licenses for new retails stores in Ontario and the build out of additional stores in Quebec. We await additional information from the authorities of each Province and Territory.

9,"(Washington, D.C., June 10, 2020) – U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue today announced a nationwide extension of another key flexibility for USDA’s child nutrition programs. This waiver allows local partners, who have been working overtime serving meals to kids during the health crisis, the ability to continue serving free meals to all children – regardless of where they live – for the remainder of the summer. This action is part of USDA’s ongoing commitment to making it as easy as possible for local program operators to get food to children impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

“As our nation reopens and people return to work, it remains critical our children continue to receive safe, healthy, and nutritious food. We are extending one of the significant flexibilities provided in March during the coronavirus national emergency to schools, summer sites, and other folks who operate our programs so they can best adapt to the situation on-the-ground and serve our children well,” said Secretary Perdue. “This nationwide flexibility ensures America’s kids will continue to be fed this summer.”

Since the start of the national public health crisis, FNS has used a whole of America approach to ensure those in need have access to one or more of the 15 nutrition assistance programs under USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service’s (FNS) umbrella. To date, FNS has approved over 2,800 flexibilities and will continue to work with states and other partners as the nation turns its focus to reopening in a safe way.

Since March, USDA has been taking swift action to ensure children are fed. In addition to this waiver extension, Secretary Perdue recently announced the extension of three additional nationwide waivers, giving child nutrition program operators the flexibility they need to continue leveraging innovative solutions in support of social distancing – such as delivery and grab n’ go – throughout the remaining summer months until school is back in session.

The nationwide waiver extended as part of today’s announcement is for area eligibility, which allows all children in all areas to receive free meals through USDA’s summer meals programs. Typically, USDA funded summer meals sites are limited to low income areas.

In addition to granting significant program flexibilities through both nationwide and state waivers, USDA has taken numerous other actions to ensure children have food to eat throughout the pandemic, including:
• Rapidly launching the Meals for Kids interactive site finder – featuring more than 60,000 sites – so families can find free meals for children in their area;
• Approving 41 states for Pandemic-EBT, which provides food-purchasing benefits, equal to the value of school meals, to households with children who would otherwise be receiving free or reduced-price meals at school; and
• Distributing more than 10 million meals in 36 states directly to low-income children in rural areas through Meals to You, a public-private partnership with the Baylor University Collaborative on Hunger and Poverty, McLane Global, and PepsiCo.

These actions and more are part of FNS’s critical response to the COVID-19 outbreak. To learn more, visit www.fns.usda.gov/coronavirus and follow FNS on Twitter at @USDANutrition.

USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service administers 15 nutrition assistance programs that leverage American’s agricultural abundance to ensure children and low-income individuals and families have nutritious food to eat. FNS also co-develops the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which provide science-based nutrition recommendations and serve as the cornerstone of federal nutrition policy.
