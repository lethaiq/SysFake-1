1,"The judgment was handed down on Tuesday in response to a Subway franchisee who had appealed for a tax refund, arguing that its bread is a ""staple"" food and therefore subject to a 0% tax rate.
Five judges considered the case, determining that Subway bread has too much sugar in it to be part of this category, and is therefore subject to a higher tax.
""The bread supplied by Subway in its heated sandwiches has a sugar content of 10% of the weight of the flour included in the dough,"" Justice Donal O'Donnell said when delivering the judgment.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/01/business/subway-bread-ireland-ruling-scli-intl/index.html,1
3,"What's blocking our everyday routines is not the anxiety of lockdown adjustments, or the worries about ourselves and our loved ones -- real though those worries are. It isn't even the sense that, if we're really honest with ourselves, much of what we do is pretty self-indulgent when held up against the urgency of a global pandemic.
It is something more troubling and harder to name: an uncertainty about why we would go on doing much of what for years we'd taken for granted as inherently valuable.
Why our brains are having so much trouble with Covid-19
Why our brains are having so much trouble with Covid-19
What we are confronting is something many writers in the pandemic have approached from varying angles: a restless distraction that stems not just from not knowing when it will all end, but also from not knowing what that end will look like. Perhaps the sharpest insight into this feeling has come from Jonathan Zecher, a historian of religion, who linked it to the forgotten Christian term: acedia.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/22/opinions/unrelenting-horizonlessness-of-covid-world-couldry-schneier/index.html,3
2,"The Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF) — a public-interest law firm dedicated to election integrity that has been involved in legal cases in nine states and the District of Columbia — filed a lawsuit against Harris County, Texas, on September 28, asserting that the state’s largest county has allowed foreign nationals to register to vote. In a petition filed in the Court of Appeals for the 14th District of Texas in Houston, PILF seeks to compel Harris County Voter Registrar Ann Bennett to follow Texas election laws and reject insufficient voter applications.
Harris County, which includes Houston, had more than four million people in the last census, and is the largest county by population in Texas.",https://www.infowars.com/largest-texas-county-adds-noncitizens-to-voter-rolls/,5

3,"Thanks to that reticence, Abe was perhaps the world’s most successful leader in managing the erratic presidency of Donald Trump. He knew Japan’s security depended on having a good relationship with Washington, no matter who was in power. And he subtly coaxed and cajoled Trump toward sensible policies that were good for Japan, and America, too.

Abe announced Friday that he will retire soon as prime minister because of poor health. It’s a moment to appreciate a leader — and a country — that don’t get as much attention as they deserve. Japan under Abe has been as stable and solid an ally as America could want — and probably better than we deserved.

“Abe had a clear strategy for his country. Japan couldn’t succeed without the United States. It didn’t matter who the president was. He needed to work with whoever was elected,” said Michael Green, the top Asia expert in the George W. Bush administration and now a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Green has been a friend of Abe for several decades and probably knows him as well as any American.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/08/29/shinzo-abe-better-ally-than-we-deserved/,3
1,"The 3,000 new infections reported in Wisconsin fanned fears that the sheer number of new patients could overwhelm hospitals. Florida, which has four times as many people as Wisconsin, reported 2,628 new cases on Thursday.

Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers issued an emergency order easing licensing rules in a bid to bolster the number of healthcare workers able to deal with the mounting crisis.

“Our emergency department has had several instances in the past week where it was past capacity and needed to place patients in beds in the hallways,” Bellin Health, which runs a hospital in Green Bay, Wisconsin, said in a statement. Its intensive care unit has been full, or nearly full, for a week, it said.

3,"As physicians and members of Congress, we know the surest and safest way to defeat coronavirus and return life to a state of normal is by developing a safe, effective vaccine.

When the coronavirus pandemic began, the Trump administration had the foresight to launch Operation Warp Speed (OWS), a multi-agency wide effort to develop and deliver a vaccine, therapeutics, and diagnostic tests that could identify and treat the virus in record time.

This public-private partnership, which uses federal research dollars to supplement and accelerate private companies’ vaccine development efforts, could now be mere months away from having a COVID-19 vaccine approved and ready to save lives.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/coronavirus-vaccine-doctors-congressmen,3
